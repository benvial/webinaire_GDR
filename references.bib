In finite element analysis the limiting factor is the skin depth, which calls for highly refined meshing in order to capture the physics. The skin depth problem has therefore prohibited the application of topology optimization to this class of problem. We present a design parameterization that remedies these numerical issues, by the interpolation of Maxwell's equations and a fictitious element impedance condition.

It is seen that the carefully optimized topologies can sharpen the filter characteristics and improve performance.

Since 2008 a device that claims to be the memristor is on the prowl, seeking recognition as a fundamental circuit element, sometimes wanting electronics textbooks to be rewritten, always promising remarkable digital, analog and neuromorphic computing possibilities. A systematic discussion about the fundamental nature of the device is almost absent within the memristor community. Advocates use incomplete constitutive relationships, ignore concepts of activity/passivity and aver that nonlinearity is central to their case. Few researchers have examined these claims. Our report investigates the assertion that the memristor is a fundamental passive circuit element, from the fresh perspective that electrical engineering is the science of charge management. We demonstrate with a periodic table of fundamental elements that the 2008 memristor is not the 1971 postulate and neither of them is fundamental. The ideal memristor is an unphysical active device and any physically realizable memristor is a nonlinear composition of resistors with active hysteresis. We also show that there exists only three fundamental passive circuit elements.},

Two broad categories are retained. In the first one the displacement field is expressed in terms of polynomials functions of the transverse variables while in the second category, non-polynomial functions are used. In each category, theories are grouped in terms of the number of unknown variables to be determined. This is a very active research area and it is shown that most theories retain only three, four or five variables even though more terms can be added.},

The cellular architecture of this plate invokes the well-known octet topology, while the metadevices rely on novel customized octets either comprising spherical masses added to the midpoint of their struts or variable node thickness. We numerically determine the dispersion curves of a doubly-periodic array of octets, which produce a broad bandgap whose underlying physics is elucidated and leveraged as a design paradigm, allowing the construction of a metabarrier effective for inhibiting the transmission of waves. More sophisticated effects emerge upon parametric analyses of the added masses and node thickness, leading to graded designs that spatially filter waves through an enlarged bandgap via rainbow trapping. Additionally, Luneburg and Maxwell metalenses are realized using the spatial modulation of the tuning parameters and numerically tested. Wavefronts impinging on these structures are progressively curved within the inhomogeneous media and steered toward a focal point. Our results yield new perspectives for the use of octet-like lattices, paving the way for promising applications in vibration isolation and energy focusing.},

Being nonpoisonous and nondestructive to the human tissues, THz signals offer promising, cost-effective, and real-time biodevices for practical pharmacological applications such as enzyme reaction analysis. Rapid developments in the field of THz plasmonics biosensors and immunosensors have brought many methodologies to employ the resonant subwavelength structures operating based on the fundamental physics of multipoles and asymmetric lineshape resonances. In the ongoing hunt for new and advanced THz plasmonic biosensors, the toroidal metasensors have emerged as excellent alternates and are introduced to be a very promising technology for THz immunosensing applications. Here, we provide examples of recently proposed THz plasmonic metasensors for the detection of thin films, chemical and biological substances. This review allows to compare the performance of various biosensing tools based on THz plasmonic approach and to understand the strategic role of toroidal metasensors in highly accurate and sensitive biosensors instrumentation. The possibility of using THz plasmonic biosensors based on toroidal technology in modern medical and clinical practices has been briefly discussed.},

These metasurfaces are considered as one of the propitious candidates for realization and development of miniaturized, surface-confined, and flat optical devices. This is because of their unprecedented capabilities to engineer the wavefronts of electromagnetic waves in reflection or transmission mode. The transmission-type metasurfaces are indispensable as the majority of optical devices operate in transmission mode. Along with other innovative applications, previous research has shown that Optical-Vortex (OV) generators based on transmission-type plasmonic metasurfaces overcome the limitations imposed by conventional OV generators. However, significant ohmic losses and the strong dispersion hampered the performance and their integration with state-of-the-art technologies. Therefore, a high contrast all-dielectric metasurface provides a compact and versatile platform to realize the OV generation. The design of this type of metasurfaces relies on the concept of Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase aiming to achieve a complete 2{$\pi$} phase control of a spin-inverted transmitted wave. Here, in this paper, we present an ultrathin, highly efficient, all-dielectric metasurface comprising nano-structured silicon on a quartz substrate. With the help of a parameter-sweep optimization, a nanoscale spatial resolution is achieved with a cross-polarized transmission efficiency as high as 95.6\% at an operational wavelength of 1.55\hspace{0.25em}\textmu m. Significantly high cross-polarized transmission efficiency has been achieved due to the excitation of electric quadrupole resonances with a very high magnitude. The highly efficient control over the phase has enabled a riveting optical phenomenon. Specifically, the phase profiles of two distinct optical devices, a lens and Spiral-Phase-Plate (SPP), can be merged together, thus producing a highly Focused-Optical-Vortex (FOV) with a maximum focusing efficiency of 75.3\%.},

  abstract = {This chapter is about the macroscopic theory of ferroelectrics, which is based on the Landau theory of phase transformations. It was first proposed by Landau in the 1930s to study a wide range of complex problems in solid-state phase transformations in general, and ordering phenomena in metallic alloys in particular (Landau and Lifshitz 1980). It was further developed and brought to the realm of ferroelectrics by Devonshire (1949, 1951). It has since then proven to be a very versatile tool in analyzing ferroelectric phenomena, and has become a de facto tool of analysis among ferroelectricians.At the heart of the Landau theory of phase transformations is the concept of order parameter, which was first proposed in the context of order\textendash disorder transformation involving a change in the crystal symmetry. In such systems, the material of interest transforms from a high-symmetry disordered phase to a low-symmetry ordered phase (de Fontaine 1979; Ziman 1979). The so-called broken symmetry of the crystal due to ordering is represented by an order parameter. Landau has shown that the (Helmholtz) free energy of an order\textendash disorder transformation can be expressed very simply as a Taylor series expansion of the order parameter describing the degree of order (or disorder). Generally, the order parameter can be any variable of the system that appears at the phase transition point. In the case of ferroelectrics, it is the spontaneous polarization. Originally, the Taylor expansion of the order parameter was intended to be limited to temperatures close to the phase transformation temperature, as any mathematical series has a radius of convergence. However, quite oddly, it is a well-established fact that the free energy functional provides a very good approximation even at temperatures far below the transition temperature once higher-order expansion terms are included.},

In nanophotonics, a central question is how to make devices in which the light-matter interaction strength is limited only by materials and nanofabrication.

We fabricate the cavity, which confines photons inside 8\,nm silicon bridges with ultra-high aspect ratios of 30 and use near-field optical measurements to perform the first experimental demonstration of photon confinement to a single hotspot well below the diffraction limit in dielectrics. Our framework intertwines topology optimization with fabrication and thereby initiates a new paradigm of high-performance additive and subtractive manufacturing.},

Surface equivalence principle for scattered fields is used in conjunction with modal expansion of fields in terms of cylindrical eigenfunctions. It is assumed that no field variation exists in axial (z) direction. Implementation of boundary conditions on scatterer surface leads to a system of linearly independent equations to solve for equivalent surface currents. Scattered fields are calculated by equivalent surface currents leading to evaluation of scattering widths (Radar Cross-Section of 2-D objects) for different observation angles. TMz polarized incident wave does not excite any TEz component. The novelty of proposed method is use of addition theorem of Bessel functions for representation of scattered fields in terms of equivalent surface currents, giving an integral equation with an analytic integrand and a well-behaved impedance matrix. Orthogonality of cylindrical modes results in excitation matrix to be a discrete function of mode numbers. Therefore, contrary to method of moments, there is no need for weighting functions. Four examples are considered, namely, line source and plane wave incidence on a 2-D PEC circular cylinder and also plane wave incidence on 2-D elliptical and equilateral triangular PEC cylinders.},

A corrector-type theorem (i.e., which permits, in some cases, replacing a sequence by its ``two-scale'' limit, up to a strongly convergent remainder in \$L\^2 (\textbackslash Omega )\$) is also established. These results are especially useful for the homogenization of partial differential equations with periodically oscillating coefficients. In particular, a new method for proving the convergence of homogenization processes is proposed, which is an alternative to the so-called energy method of Tartar. The power and simplicity of the two-scale convergence method is demonstrated on several examples, including the homogenization of both linear and nonlinear second-order elliptic equations.},

The conformal FSS is 3D printed and copper electroplated, which leads to a low-cost and lightweight bandpass filter array. Placing it in the near-field region of a primary antenna can be used as radomes to realize compact high-performance mm-wave systems.

Conventional metasurface device design relies on trial-and-error methods to obtain target electromagnetic (EM) responses, an approach that demands significant efforts to investigate the enormous number of possible meta-atom structures. In this paper, a deep learning modeling approach is introduced that significantly improves on both speed and accuracy compared to techniques currently used to characterize the subwavelength optical structures. Our neural network approach overcomes two key challenges that have limited previous neural-network-based design schemes: input/output vector dimensional mismatch and accurate EM-wave phase prediction. Additionally, this is the first neural network to characterize 3-D dielectric structures. By combining with optimization algorithms or neural networks, this approach can be generically applied to a wide variety of metasurface device designs across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Using this new methodology, examples of neural networks capable of producing on-demand designs for meta-atoms, metasurface filters, and phase-change reconfigurable metasurfaces are demonstrated.},

Photonic band structures, transmission coefficients, and quality factors of various two-dimensional, periodic and aperiodic, dielectric photonic crystals are calculated by using the FE (real-space) method and the plane wave expansion or the finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods and a comparison is established between those results. It is found that, contrarily to popular belief, the FE method (FEM) not only reproduces extremely well the results obtained with the standard plane wave method with regards to the eigenvalue analysis (photonic band structure and density of states calculations) but it also allows to study very easily the time-harmonic propagation of electromagnetic fields in finite clusters of arbitrary complexity and, thus, to calculate their transmission coefficients in a simple way. Moreover, the advantages of using this real space method in the context of point defect cluster quality factor calculations are also stressed by comparing the results obtained with this method with those obtained with the FDTD one. As a result of this study, FEM comes out as an stable, robust, rigorous, and reliable tool to study light propagation and confinement in both periodic and aperiodic dielectric photonic crystals and clusters.},

  abstract = {Metasurfaces are being widely investigated and adopted for their promising performances in manipulating optical wavefronts and their potential for integrating multi-functionalities into one flat optical device. A key challenge in metasurface design is the non-intuitive design process that produces models and patterns from specific design requirements (commonly electromagnetic responses). A complete exploration of all design spaces can produce optimal designs but is unrealistic considering the massive amount of computation power required to explore large parameter spaces. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques, especially generative adversarial networks, have proven to be an effective solution to non-intuitive design tasks. In this paper, we present a novel conditional generative network that can generate meta-atom/metasurface designs based on different performance requirements. Compared to conventional trial-and-error or iterative optimization design methods, this new methodology is capable of producing on-demand freeform designs on a one-time calculation basis. More importantly, an increased complexity of design goals doesn't introduce further complexity into the network structure or the training process, which makes this approach suitable for multi-functional device designs. Compared to previous deep learning-based metasurface approaches, our network structure is extremely robust to train and converge, and is readily expanded to many multi-functional metasurface devices, including metasurface filters, lenses and holograms.},

  abstract = {A novel microwave noninvasive planar sensor based on the complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) is proposed for an accurate measurement of the complex permittivity of materials. The CSRR is etched in the ground plane of the planar microstrip line. Two CSRRs of rectangular and circular cross-sections are chosen for the sensitivity analysis, where the later is found to possess higher sensitivity and hence appears to be more appropriate for the sensor design. At resonance, the electric field induced along the plane of CSRR is found to be quite sensitive for the characterization of specimen kept in contact with the sensor. A numerical model is developed here for the calculation of the complex permittivity as a function of resonant frequency and the quality factor data using the electromagnetic simulator, the Computer Simulation Technology. For practical applications, a detailed air gap analysis is carried out to consider the effect of any air gap present between the test sample and the CSRR. The designed sensor is fabricated and tested, and accordingly the numerically established relations are experimentally verified for various reference samples e.g., teflon, polyvinyl chloride, plexiglas, polyethylene, rubber, and wood. Experimentally, it is found that the permittivity measurement using the proposed sensor is possible with a typical error of 3\%.},

We demonstrate how one replaces such structures asymptotically by a continuum, and therefore by a set of equations, that captures the behaviour of potentially high-frequency waves propagating through a periodic medium. The high-frequency homogenization that we use recovers the classical homogenization coefficients in the low-frequency long-wavelength limit. The theory is specifically developed in electromagnetics for two-dimensional square lattices where every cell contains an arbitrary hole with Neumann boundary conditions at its surface and implemented numerically for cylinders and split-ring resonators. Illustrative numerical examples include lensing via all-angle negative refraction, as well as omni-directive antenna, endoscope and cloaking effects. We also highlight the importance of choosing the correct Brillouin zone and the potential of missing interesting physical effects depending upon the path chosen.},

  abstract = {We present an accurate methodology for representing the physics of waves, in periodic structures, through effective properties for a replacement bulk medium: this is valid even for media with zero-frequency stop bands and where high-frequency phenomena dominate. Since the work of Lord Rayleigh in 1892, low-frequency (or quasi-static) behaviour has been neatly encapsulated in effective anisotropic media; the various parameters come from asymptotic analysis relying upon the ratio of the array pitch to the wavelength being sufficiently small. However, such classical homogenization theories break down in the high-frequency or stop band regime whereby the wavelength to pitch ratio is of order one. Furthermore, arrays of inclusions with Dirichlet data lead to a zero-frequency stop band, with the salient consequence that classical homogenization is invalid. Higher-frequency phenomena are of significant importance in photonics (transverse magnetic waves propagating in infinite conducting parallel fibres), phononics (anti-plane shear waves propagating in isotropic elastic materials with inclusions) and platonics (flexural waves propagating in thin-elastic plates with holes). Fortunately, the recently proposed high-frequency homogenization (HFH) theory is only constrained by the knowledge of standing waves in order to asymptotically reconstruct dispersion curves and associated Floquet\textendash Bloch eigenfields: it is capable of accurately representing zero-frequency stop band structures. The homogenized equations are partial differential equations with a dispersive anisotropic homogenized tensor that characterizes the effective medium. We apply HFH to metamaterials, exploiting the subtle features of Bloch dispersion curves such as Dirac-like cones, as well as zero and negative group velocity near stop bands in order to achieve exciting physical phenomena such as cloaking, lensing and endoscope effects. These are simulated numerically using finite elements and compared to predictions from HFH. An extension of HFH to periodic supercells enabling complete reconstruction of dispersion curves through an unfolding technique is also introduced.},

  abstract = {We have developed a general methodology for computing electromagnetic (EM) fields and forces in matter, based on solving the macroscopic Maxwell's equations numerically in real space and adopting the time-averaged Maxwell stress tensor formalism. We can treat both dielectric and metallic systems characterized by a local frequency-dependent dielectric function, and of any size and geometry in principle. In this paper, we are particularly interested in calculating forces on nanostructures, induced by a beam of monochromatic light (such as a laser). The motivation behind this particular direction is the facilitation of self assembly in colloidal systems with the aim of aiding the fabrication of photonic crystals. We first look at two homogeneous systems: a half space and a layer. In passing from a low-{$\epsilon$} to a high-{$\epsilon$} medium, the light beam always attracts the interface (i.e., the surface force is negative). Thus the surfaces of two liquids separated by a layer of lower {$\epsilon$} will generally be attracted towards each other, whereas for solids the total force must also be negative. This condition is not satisfied for the EM field of a traveling wave, but may be fulfilled for an evanescent wave. Thus, by shining evanescent light in the region between two solid bodies an attraction between them may be induced. We then study the EM forces induced by a laser beam on a three-dimensional crystal of dielectric spheres of GaP in air. At wavelengths comparable to the lattice constant, multiple scattering effects tune in: band gaps, Bragg scattering. But in all these cases the incident beam induces positive pressure on (and between) the spheres. Much more interesting is the regime where the radiation couples to the EM eigenmodes supported by isolated spheres (Mie resonances). These modes are analogous to electronic orbitals and, like their electronic counterparts, can form bonding and antibonding interactions between neighboring spheres. By irradiating the system with light at the bonding frequency an attractive interaction is induced between the spheres. For moderate intensities of the incident radiation these forces can overcome all other interactions present (gravitational, thermal, and Van der Waals) and may provide the main mechanism for formation of stable crystal structures in colloidal systems.},

We show that the LDOS decreases exponentially inside the crystal for frequencies within a photonic band gap of the associated infinite array and demonstrate that there exist ``hot'' and ``cold'' spots inside the cluster even for wavelengths inside a gap, and also for wavelengths corresponding to pass bands. For long wavelengths the LDOS exhibits oscillatory behavior in which the local density of states can be more than 30 times higher than the vacuum level.},

  abstract = {Metamaterials exhibit properties beyond those exhibited by conventional materials in conventional scenarios. These have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally at length. In many cases the underpinning physical understanding of metamaterials has greatly preceded our ability to manufacture constituent structures. However, the development of additive manufacturing techniques gives new possibilities for the fabrication of complex metamaterial structures, many of which cannot be realised through conventional fabrication methods. The literature to date contains contributions from a diverse group of researchers from the physical sciences, mathematics, and manufacturing technology in the creation of metamaterials for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical applications. It is proposed that additive manufacturing holds the key to realise the capabilities of this vibrant research community and permit the creation of new paradigms in fundamental structures but also exploitation through application. For this purpose, a literature review is presented which identifies key advances in metamaterials alongside additive manufacturing and proposes new opportunities for researchers to work together through intra/inter disciplinary research to realise structures which exhibit extraordinary behaviour(s). This review represents a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in the production of such metamaterials using additive manufacturing methods and highlights areas, which, based on trends observed in the literature, are worthy of further research and require a coordinated effort on behalf of the afore mentioned disciplines in order to advance the state-of-the-art.},

In other words, when considering the propagation of elastic waves in such media, displacement and stress discontinuities are allowed across the borders of the periodic cell. As is customary in high-frequency homogenization, the homogenization is carried out about the periodic and antiperiodic solutions corresponding to the edges of the Brillouin zone. Asymptotic approximations are provided for both the higher branches of the dispersion diagram (second-order) and the resulting wave field (leading-order). The special case of two branches of the dispersion diagram intersecting with a non-zero slope at an edge of the Brillouin zone (occurrence of a so-called Dirac point) is also considered in detail, resulting in an approximation of the dispersion diagram (first-order) and the wave field (zeroth-order) near these points. Finally, a uniform approximation valid for both Dirac and non-Dirac points is provided. Numerical comparisons are made with the exact solutions obtained by the Bloch\textendash Floquet approach for the particular examples of monolayered and bilayered materials. In these two cases, convergence measurements are carried out to validate the approach, and we show that the uniform approximation remains a very good approximation even far from the edges of the Brillouin zone.},

However, there is no literature on the finite element formulation of second-order strain gradient elastic plates. The weak form of the governing equation of motion of the Kirchhoff nanoplate using second-order positive/negative strain gradient nonlocal theories requires C2 continuity of transverse displacement. In this paper, a new computationally efficient nonconforming finite element formulation for the modelling of nanoplates using second-order positive/negative strain gradient nonlocal theories is presented. The performance of the developed finite element is compared with conforming finite element for rectangular isotropic Kirchhoff nanoplates with different boundary conditions. Analytical solution for static bending, free vibration, and buckling under biaxial in-plane compressive loading are also obtained for rectangular all edges simply supported isotropic Kirchhoff nanoplate for the comparison purpose. The nonconforming element is found to be computationally more efficient than the conforming element with better accuracy and convergence rate. The negative strain gradient model predicts results matching with the experimental results available in the literature.},

Our approach is based on computational inverse design, also known as the adjoint-gradient method. This technique enables thousands or millions of independent design variables (e.g., the shapes of individual meta-atoms) to be optimized in parallel, with little or no intervention required by the user. The assumptions underlying our method are as follows: we use the local periodic approximation to determine the phase-response of a given meta-atom, we use the scalar wave approximation to propagate light fields between metasurface layers, and we do not consider multiple reflections between metasurface layers (analogous to a sequential-optics ray-tracer). To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we use it to design an achromatic doublet metasurface lens, a spectrally-multiplexed holographic element, and an ultra-compact optical neural network for classifying handwritten digits.},

Traditional approaches usually rely on stimulated deformations of active materials under external electric/magnetic fields, which could potentially introduce parasitic side effects and lower device performances. Development of a rational strategy that allows access to high-performance 3D microdevices with multiple stable geometric configurations remains challenging. We introduce a mechanically guided scheme to build geometrically reconfigurable 3D mesostructures through a bottom-up design strategy based on a class of elementary reconfigurable structures with the simplest ribbon geometries. Quantitative mechanics modeling of the structural reconfigurability allows for the development of phase diagrams and design maps. Demonstrations of \textasciitilde 30 reconfigurable mesostructures with diverse geometric topologies and characteristic dimensions illustrate the versatile applicability. The multimode nature enables customized distinct beamforming and discrete beam scanning using a single antenna capable of on-demand reconfiguration. A rational bottom-up design strategy was developed to build microelectronic devices capable of 3D geometrical reconfiguration.

Two main classes of abnormal PSFs are examined: single-lobed PSFs, in which the localization bias arises from various emitter positions around the nanowire, and bilobed PSFs arising from emitters near the top edge of the nanowire. The amount of localization bias for these two populations diverges for ground truth widths less than 300 nm and suggests the latter adsorption and resulting orientation arise more frequently under experimental conditions than is predicted by simulation. Nanowires with widths in the range of 200 to 300 nm are found to have the greatest potential for distinguishing between single-lobed and bilobed PSFs in experiment. Finally, we present a fitting method for abnormal PSFs using a basis of Hermite\textendash Gaussian functions and show that orientation information is encoded in bilobed PSFs.},

The equations are valid for both dielectric and magnetic materials. The model allows the study of the open-ended coaxial probe as a nondestructive testing tool. The analysis allows a study of the effects of air gaps on probe measurements. The reflection coefficient and phase are studied as a function of lift-off, coaxial line size, permittivity, permeability, and frequency. Numerical results indicate that the probe is very sensitive to lift-off. For medium to high permittivity values and electrically small probes, gaps on the order of fractions of a millimeter strongly influence the reflection coefficient. In order for the field to penetrate through the air gap, larger size coaxial line or higher frequencies need to be used. A comparison of the theory to experiment is presented.

  abstract = {Metasurfaces advanced the field of optics by reducing the thickness of optical components and merging multiple functionalities into a single layer device. However, this generally comes with a reduction in performance, especially for multi-functional and broadband applications. Three-dimensional metastructures can provide the necessary degrees of freedom for advanced applications, while maintaining minimal thickness. This work explores mechanically reconfigurable devices that perform focusing, spectral demultiplexing, and polarization sorting based on mechanical configuration. As proof of concept, a rotatable device, a device based on rotating squares, and a shearing-based device are designed with adjoint-based topology optimization, 3D-printed, and measured at microwave frequencies (7.6\textendash 11.6~GHz) in an anechoic chamber.},

With the introduction of digital metamaterials, a bridge between the physical world and the information world is set up. When the digital metamaterials are programmable, they enable the wave-based information coding and processing on the physical level of metamaterials in real time. In this paper, we will summarize the recent progress on tunable, reconfigurable, and programmable metamaterials.

Major industrial research efforts in quantum computing are currently underway at many companies, including IBM [2], Microsoft [3], Google [4], [5], Alibaba [6], and Intel [7], to name a few. The European Union [8], Australia [9], China [10], Japan [11], Canada [12], Russia [13], and the United States [14] are each funding large national research initiatives focused on the quantum information sciences. And, recently, tens of start-up companies have emerged with goals ranging from the development of software for use on quantum computers [15] to the implementation of full-fledged quantum computers (e.g., Rigetti [16], ION-Q [17], Psi-Quantum [18], and so on). However, despite this rapid growth, because quantum computing as a field brings together many different disciplines, there is currently a shortage of engineers who understand both the engineering aspects (e.g., microwave design) and the quantum aspects required to build a quantum computer [19]. The aim of this article is to introduce microwave engineers to quantum computing and demonstrate how the microwave community's expertise could contribute to that field.},

We show that the LDOS governs the efficiency of a macroscopic classical antenna, determining how the antenna's emission depends on its environment. The LDOS is shown to similarly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter, such as an excited atom, molecule, ion, or quantum dot that is embedded in a nanostructured optical environment. The difference between the number density of optical states, the LDOS, and the partial LDOS is elaborated and examples are provided for each density of states to illustrate where these are required. We illustrate the universal effect of the LDOS on emission by comparing systems with emission wavelengths that differ by more than 5 orders of magnitude, and systems whose decay rates differ by more than 5 orders of magnitude. To conclude we discuss and resolve an apparent difference between the classical and quantum expressions for the spontaneous emission rate that often seems to be overlooked, and discuss the experimental determination of the LDOS.},

Due to multiple reflections that occur in case of a material slab with finite dimensions these coefficients also strongly depend on the materials thickness. This paper describes an approach to determine the electromagnetic properties of a material under test by applying an ellipsometric measurement without knowledge of the materials thickness. The paper shows that the additional measurement of the transmission coefficients allows to perform an exact measurement of the complex permittivity since the thickness dependencies in reflection and transmission coefficients are removed.

While numerical optimization is increasingly and successfully used in photonics, it has yet to replicate any of these complex naturally occurring structures. Using evolutionary algorithms inspired by natural evolution and performing particular optimizations (maximize reflection for a given wavelength, for a broad range of wavelength or maximize the scattering of light), we have retrieved the most stereotypical natural photonic structures. Whether those structures are Bragg mirrors, chirped dielectric mirrors or the gratings on top of Morpho butterfly wings, our results indicate how such regular structures might have spontaneously emerged in nature and to which precise optical or fabrication constraints they respond. Comparing algorithms show that recombination between individuals, inspired by sexual reproduction, confers a clear advantage that can be linked to the fact that photonic structures are fundamentally modular: each part of the structure has a role which can be understood almost independently from the rest. Such an in silico evolution also suggests original and elegant solutions to practical problems, as illustrated by the design of counter-intuitive anti-reflective coatings for solar cells.},

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "auto-diff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational uid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

PyLlama is also designed to suit the practical needs by allowing the user to create, edit and assemble layers or multilayered domains with great ease. In this article, we present the electromagnetic theory underlying the transfer matrix and scattering matrix methods and outline the architecture and main features of PyLlama. Finally, we validate the code by comparison with available analytical solutions and demonstrate its versatility and numerical stability by modelling cholesteric media of varying complexity. A detailed documentation and tutorial are provided in a separate user manual.

An array of metallic wires behaves to a first approximation as a material with extreme optical anisotropy characterized by the dielectric function. The imaging properties of wire medium lenses can be predicted to a very good approximation using homogenization methods. Processing of subwavelength images, such as magnification or demagnification, can be performed by tapering the array of wires.

Here we present a very general formulation of inverse design that is applicable to atomic interactions in external environments, and derive from this some explicit formulae for optimisation of spontaneous decay rates, Casimir-Polder forces and resonant energy transfer. Using the Q factor of the latter as an example, we use finite-difference time-domain techniques to demonstrate the ability of inverse design algorithms to go far beyond what can be achieved by intuition-based approaches, opening up a new route to their technological exploitation.},

  abstract = {Stable and accurate modeling of thin shells requires proper enforcement of all types of boundary conditions. Unfortunately, for Kirchhoff\textendash Love shells, strong enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions is difficult because both displacement and normal rotation boundary conditions must be applied. A popular alternative is to employ Nitsche's method to weakly enforce all boundary conditions. However, while many Nitsche-based formulations have been proposed in the literature, they lack comprehensive error analyses and verification. In fact, existing formulations are variationally inconsistent and yield sub-optimal convergence rates when used with common boundary condition specifications. In this paper, we present a novel Nitsche-based formulation for the linear Kirchhoff\textendash Love shell that is provably stable and optimally convergent for general sets of admissible boundary conditions. To arrive at our formulation, we first present a framework for constructing Nitsche's method for any abstract variationally constrained minimization problem. We then apply this framework to the linear Kirchhoff\textendash Love shell and, for the particular case of NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, we prove that the resulting formulation yields optimal convergence rates in both the shell energy norm and the standard L2-norm. To arrive at this formulation, we derive the Euler\textendash Lagrange equations for general sets of admissible boundary conditions and show that the Euler\textendash Lagrange boundary conditions typically presented in the literature are incorrect. We verify our formulation by manufacturing solutions for a new shell obstacle course that encompasses flat, parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometric configurations with a variety of common boundary condition specifications. These manufactured solutions allow us to robustly measure the error across the entire shell in contrast with current best practices where displacement and stress errors are only measured at specific locations. We use NURBS discretizations to represent the shell geometry and show optimal convergence rates in both the shell energy norm and the standard L2-norm with varying polynomial degrees for all of the problems in the obstacle course.},

Consequently our method provides the possibility of performing reliable calculations of the dielectric constant of periodic composites that are neither dilute nor low contrast, and are not restricted to arrays of nonoverlapping spheres.

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success\textendash they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

Here we show how to do numerical computations with equal accuracy using much thicker layers. We use a truncated power series to approximate the variation of optical parameters through each layer. We also show two ways to obtain fast convergence of numerical computations with layers of homogeneous anisotropic material that are several wavelengths thick. We use the method to get a better understanding of the optical properties of twist cells, particularly for oblique rays. The possibility of measuring elastic constants by comparing measured with computed transmittance of twist cells is suggested.},

This result demonstrates the possibility of identifying the electric permittivity of different materials in a thin film sample irrespectively of their thickness by just direct imaging and processing. We show, in addition, that quantitative maps of the electric permittivity can be obtained with no need for any theoretical calculation or complex quantification procedures when the electric permittivity of one of the materials is known. To achieve these results the use of contact mode imaging is a key factor. For non-contact imaging modes the effects of local sample thickness and of the imaging distance make the interpretation of the capacitance images in terms of the electric permittivity properties of the materials much more complex. The present results represent a substantial contribution to the field of nanoscale microwave dielectric characterization of thin film materials with important implications for the characterization of novel 3D electronic devices and 3D nanomaterials.},

The size and complexity of the discretized PDEs often pose significant challenges for contemporary optimization methods. Recent advances in algorithms, software, and high performance computing systems have resulted in PDE simulations that can often scale to millions of variables, thousands of processors, and multiple physics interactions. As PDE solvers mature, there is increasing interest in industry and the national labs in solving optimization problems governed by such large-scale simulations. This article provides a brief introduction and overview to the Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering volume entitled Large-Scale PDE-Constrained Optimization.This volume contains nineteen articles that were initially presented at the First Sandia Workshop on Large-Scale PDE-Constrained Optimization. The articles in this volume assess the state-of-the-art in PDE-constrained optimization, identify challenges to optimization presented by modern highly parallel PDE simulation codes and discuss promising algorithmic and software approaches to address them. These contributions represent current research of two strong scientific computing communities, in optimization and PDE simulation. This volume merges perspectives in these two different areas and identifies interesting open questions for further research. We hope that this volume leads to greater synergy and collaboration between these communities.},

By guiding the PSO to the optimum, the local convergence speed can be vastly improved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using regression on several static multimodal test functions as well as dynamicmultimodal test scenarios (Moving Peaks). This chapter also extends theMoving Peaks test suite by enhancing the standard conic peak function to allow the creation of asymmetrical and additional multiple local peaks. The combination of this technique and a speciation-based PSO compares favourably to another multi-swarm PSO algorithm that has proven to be working well on the Moving peaks test functions.},

  abstract = {We theoretically study single and two-qubit dynamics in the circuit QED architecture. We focus on the current experimental design [Wallraff et al., Nature (London) 431, 162 (2004); Schuster et al., Nature (London) 445, 515 (2007)] in which superconducting charge qubits are capacitively coupled to a single high-Q superconducting coplanar resonator. In this system, logical gates are realized by driving the resonator with microwave fields. Advantages of this architecture are that it allows for multiqubit gates between non-nearest qubits and for the realization of gates in parallel, opening the possibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconduting circuits. In this paper, we focus on one- and two-qubit gates that do not require moving away from the charge-degeneracy ``sweet spot.'' This is advantageous as it helps to increase the qubit dephasing time and does not require modification of the original circuit QED. However, these gates can, in some cases, be slower than those that do not use this constraint. Five types of two-qubit gates are discussed, these include gates based on virtual photons, real excitation of the resonator, and a gate based on the geometric phase. We also point out the importance of selection rules when working at the charge degeneracy point.},

Finding the right geometry for a specific property remains a fastidious and long task, even with the help of modelling tools. In this work, we overcome this challenge by using artificial intelligence to guide a reverse engineering method. We present an optimization algorithm based on a deep convolution generative adversarial network for the design a 2-dimensional optical cloak. The optical cloak consists in a shell of uniform and isotropical dielectric material, and the cloaking is achieved via the geometry of this shell. We use a feedback loop from the solutions of this generative network to successively retrain it and improve its ability to predict and find optimal geometries. This generative method allows to find a global solution to the optimization problem without any prior knowledge of good cloaking geometries.},

The nonlinearity is then found to lead to self and cross-Kerr effects, as well as beam-splitter-type interactions between modes. By adjusting the parameters of the circuit, the Kerr coefficient K can be made to reach values that are weak (K{$<\kappa$}), strong (K{$>\kappa$}), or even very strong (K{$\gg\kappa$}) with respect to the photon-loss rate {$\kappa$}. In the latter case, the resonator+junction circuit corresponds to an in-line version of the transmon. By replacing the single junction by a SQUID, the Kerr coefficient can be tuned in situ, allowing, for example, the fast generation of Schr\"odinger cat states of microwave light.

  abstract = {This paper aims at investigating how to suppress combustion instability using perforated liners under nonlinear flame response. A theoretical model is thus presented to describe the interaction between the unsteady heat release, acoustics, and fluid fields, which takes both perforated liner and flame nonlinearity into account. To establish an eigenvalue problem to evaluate combustion instability, appropriate matching and boundary conditions are set up by applying conservation laws across the interfaces, consequently deriving the dispersion relation equation in the form of a matrix. In view of the nonlinearity of flame response function, it is found that the control strategy of combustion instability should be devoted to the reduction of the limit cycle amplitude to an acceptable level rather than the complete elimination of its onset. Based on the present model, we have studied the first longitudinal mode of a Rijke tube equipped with perforated liners. It is noted that the change of combustion instability evolution is sensitive to the design parameters of perforated liners, including cavity depth, installation position, and bias flow velocity. On the one hand, it is indeed possible to suppress the onset of combustion instability with elaborately designed parameters of the perforated liners. On the other hand, the limit cycle amplitude can be reduced as small as possible under various design restrictions of perforated liners in practice. Therefore, this study presents an alternative design criteria of perforated liners for the control of combustion instability. We investigate structured arrays and rings in elasticity to design elastic platonic circuits that utilise resonant phenomena. Creating ring resonators, and understanding their coupling to input and output arrays, allows for the development of platonic circuits including add\textendash drop filters (ADFs) and coupled resonator elastic arrays (CREAs), and hence we envisage integrated platonic devices. Structured rings of point-masses placed atop a thin elastic plate lead to highly confined quasi-modes that leak energy; the leakage being quantified by the limiting quality factor QQ{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="script"{$>$}Q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}. The conditions of resonance are deduced using highly accurate numerical simulations based on a Green's function approach to solve the dispersion relation associated with the structured ring resonators. The sharp resonances that emerge are then used to filter and direct wave energy based on input frequency, and this is illustrated through analogy with devices used in optics, e.g. integrated photonic circuits. The potential applications of the elastic devices include elastic delay lines and passive energy harvesters. Theoretical investigation is carried out by a novel method of controlling thermoacoustic instability with a drum-like silencer. It is shown that by decreasing the frequency of thermoacoustic system, the instability can be suppressed with the help of drum-like silencer. The purely reactive silencer, which is composed of a flexible membrane and a backing cavity, is usually known as a noise control device that works effectively in low frequency bandwidth without any aerodynamic loss. In present research, the silencer is exploited in a Rijke tube, as a means of decreasing the natural frequency of the system, and consequently changing the resonance period of the system. The ``transfer element method'' (TEM) is used to consider the interactions between the acoustic waves and the flexible membranes of the silencer. The effects of all possible properties of the silencer on the growth rate and resonance frequency of the thermoacoustic system are explored. According to the calculation results, it is found that for some properties of the silencer, the resonance frequencies are greatly decreased and then the phase difference between the unsteady heat release and the pressure fluctuation is increased. Consequently, the instability is suppressed with some dissipation that can not be able to control its onset in the original system. Therefore, when the damping is low, but not zero, it is effective to control thermoacoustic instability with this technique. This chapter presents some common sound propagation modeling methods: ray tracing, wave number integration, normal-mode expansion, parabolic equation approximation, and finite-difference (FD) and finite-element (FE) discretization. Although the main focus is on frequency-domain methods for a fluid medium, fluid\textendash solid media are treated for some methods, and some FD and FE time-domain techniques are included. Except in a final section on 3-D modeling, the common 2-D case is assumed, with cylindrical symmetry around a vertical source axis. The reflection-coefficient matrix method (invariant embedding) recurs, with essentially the same formalism, for several purposes: solution of depth-dependent differential equation systems, computation of normal-mode shapes, and determination of range-dependent modal expansion coefficients for 2-D as well as 3-D cases. Published examples are used to illustrate the FD and FE methods, while variations of a certain shallow-water propagation case are discussed for the other methods. Range dependence and 3-D effects are illustrated by simple examples with diagonal mode-coupling matrices. A three-dimensional compressible flow stability model is presented in this paper, which focuses on stall inception of multi-stage axial flow compressors with a finite large radius annular duct configuration for the first time. It is shown that under some assumptions, the stability equation can be obtained yielding from a group of homogeneous equations. The stability can be judged by the non-dimensional imaginary part of the resultant complex frequency eigenvalue. Further more, based on the analysis of the unsteady phenomenon caused by casing treatment, the function of casing treatment has been modeled by a wall impedance condition which is included in the stability model through the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the system. Finally, some experimental investigation and two numerical evaluation cases are conducted to validate this model and emphasis is placed on numerically studying the sensitivity of the setup of different boundary conditions on the stall inception of axial flow fan/compressors. A novel casing treatment which consists of a backchamber and a perforated plate is suggested, and it is noted that the open area ratio of the casing treatment is less than 10\%, and is far smaller than conventional casing treatment with open area ratio of over 50\%, which could result in stall margin improvement without obvious efficiency loss of fan/compressors. A stall inception model for transonic fan/compressors is presented in this paper. It can be shown that under some assumptions the solution of unsteady flow field consists of pressure wave which propagates upstream or downstream, vortex wave and entropy wave convected with the mean flow speed. By further using the mode-matching technique and applying the conservation law and conditions reflecting the loss characteristics of a compressor in the inlet and outlet of the rotor or stator blade rows, a group of homogeneous equations can be obtained from which the stability equation can be derived. Based on the analysis of the unsteady phenomenon caused by casing treatments, the function of casing treatments has been modeled by a wall impedance condition which has been included in the stability model through the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the system. Besides, the effect of shock waves in cascade channel on the stability prediction is also considered in the stall inception model. Finally, some numerical analysis and experimental investigation are also conducted with emphasis on the mutual comparison.},

  abstract = {Dielectric properties of heterogeneous materials for various condensed-matter systems have been gaining world-wide attention over the past 50 or so years in the design (or engineering) of materials structures for desired properties and functional purposes. These applications range from cable and current limiters to sensors. These multiscale systems lead to challenging problems of connecting micro- or meso-structural features to macroscopic materials response, i.e. permittivity, conductivity. This article first reviews progress made at that time of the underlying physics of dielectric heterostructures and points out the missing elements that have led to a resurgence of interest in these and related materials. Recent advances in computational electromagnetics provide unparalleled control over morphology in this class of materials to produce a seemingly unlimited number of exquisitely structured materials endowed with tailored electromagnetic, and other physical properties. In the text to follow, we illustrate how an ab initio computational technique can be used to accurately characterize structure\textendash dielectric property relationships of periodic heterostructures in the quasistatic limit. More specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical studies of two-component materials in which equal-sized inclusions, with shape and orientation and possibly fused together, are fixed in a periodic square (2D) or cubic (3D) array. Boundary-integral equations (BIE) are derived from Green's theorem and are solved for the local field with appropriate periodicity conditions on a unit cell of the structures using the field calculation package PHI3D. A number of illustrative examples shows how this computational technique can provide very accurate predictions for the complex effective permittivity of translationally-invariant heterostructures. The performance of the method is also compared with those of other computational and analytical techniques. We comment on how this computational method helps identify some important characteristics for rationalizing and predicting the structure of composite materials in terms of the nature, size, shape and orientation of their constituents.},

Our attention is paid to materials which exhibit some interesting low-frequency polar-phonon anomalies in combination with some additional dielectric dispersion below the polar phonon region. The following compounds are discussed: microwave ceramics Bi1.5Zn1.0Nb1.5O7, antiferroelectric PbZrO3ceramics and AgNbO3crystals, ferroelectric LiNaGe4O9, LaBGeO5, Cd2Nb2O7and SrBi2Ta2O9crystals, incommensurate ferroelectric Sr2Nb2O7, Ba2NaNb5O15and BCCD crystals, dipolar-glass crystal of Rb1/2(ND4)1/2D2PO4, relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Sc1/2Ta1/2)O3and PLZT ceramics and PMN crystals, antiferroelectric PLZT 2/95/5 ceramics and relaxor-based PMN-PT, PZN-PT and BiScO3-PT crystals and ceramics. For these materials the polar phonon spectra are discussed together with their flow-frequency dielectric response and dispersion regions in between, in the 10\textendash 300 K or higher temperature range, depending on the existing phase transitions of interest. Some universal features of the disorder and anharmonicities are pointed out: central-mode phenomena near displacive phase transitions and polar nano-clusters which appear at rather high temperatures and remain present down to low temperatures if the material remains structurally disordered. The manifestation of the latter in the dielectric spectra consists in extreme broadening of the relaxation region on cooling which at low temperatures results in constant loss spectra (1/fnoise).},

These include colloidal suspensions, inverted opals, and macroporous silicon. We show that complete three-dimensional PBGs spanning roughly 10\% and 15\% of the gap center frequency are attainable by incomplete infiltration of an opal with silicon and germanium, respectively. The photonic band structure of both face center cubic and hexagonal close packed photonic crystals are evaluated. We delineate how the PBG is modified by sintering the opal prior to infiltration and by applying strain along various crystallographic directions. We evaluate the total photon density of states as well as the local density of states (LDOS) projected onto various points within the photonic crystal. It is shown that the LDOS may exhibit considerable pseudogap structure even for systems that do not exhibit a complete PBG. These results are directly relevant to quantum optical experiments in which atoms, dye molecules, or other active materials are inserted into specific locations within the photonic crystal. When the resonant optical transition of these dopants is tuned close to a pseudogap or other abrupt structure in the LDOS, novel effects in radiative dynamics associated with a ``colored vacuum'' may be realized.},

Standard continuous piecewise linear finite element approximation yields O(h) optimal accuracy for w, which, in turn, implies the same accuracy for u in the H1 norm. We are able only to prove \$O(h\^\{1+\{\textbackslash pi\textbackslash over\{\textbackslash omega\}\}\})\$ error bounds for w and u in the L2 norm and for {$\lambda$} in the absolute value, where {$\omega$} is the internal angle.},

In addition, the design is not sensitive to the object that is being cloaked. The first experimental demonstration of such a cloak at microwave frequencies was recently reported. We note, however, that that design cannot be implemented for an optical cloak, which is certainly of particular interest because optical frequencies are where the word 'invisibility' is conventionally defined.

  abstract = {Polynomial eigenvalue problems are often found in scientific computing applications. When the coefficient matrices of the polynomial are large and sparse, usually only a few eigenpairs are required and projection methods are the best choice. We focus on Krylov methods that operate on the companion linearization of the polynomial but exploit the block structure with the aim of being memory-efficient in the representation of the Krylov subspace basis. The problem may appear in the form of a low-degree polynomial (quartic or quintic, say) expressed in the monomial basis, or a high-degree polynomial (coming from interpolation of a nonlinear eigenproblem) expressed in a nonmonomial basis. We have implemented a parallel solver in SLEPc covering both cases that is able to compute exterior as well as interior eigenvalues via spectral transformation. We discuss important issues such as scaling and restart and illustrate the robustness and performance of the solver with some numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {To retrieve complex-valued effective permittivity and permeability of electromagnetic metamaterials (EMMs) based on resonant effect from scattering parameters using a complex logarithmic function is not inevitable. When complex values are expressed in terms of magnitude and phase, an infinite number of permissible phase angles is permissible due to the multi-valued property of complex logarithmic functions. Special attention needs to be paid to ensure continuity of the effective permittivity and permeability of lossy metamaterials as frequency sweeps. In this paper, an automated phase correction (APC) algorithm is proposed to properly trace and compensate phase angles of the complex logarithmic function which may experience abrupt phase jumps near the resonant frequency region of the concerned EMMs, and hence the continuity of the effective optical properties of lossy metamaterials is ensured. The algorithm is then verified to extract effective optical properties from the simulated scattering parameters of the four different types of metamaterial media: a cut-wire cell array, a split ring resonator (SRR) cell array, an electric-LC (E-LC) resonator cell array, and a combined SRR and wire cell array respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly accurate and effective.},

By applying the TO technique, the original device model is transformed into an equivalent model that consists of uniform and fixed-sized rods, with parameterized permittivity and permeability distributions. Therefore, mesh refinement around small rods can be avoided, and PhC devices can be simulated more efficiently. In addition, gradient of the optimization object function is calculated with the Adjoint-Variable Method (AVM), which is very efficient for optimizing devices subject to multiple design variables.

This paper proposes an isogeometric topology optimization framework to implement the simultaneous optimization of fiber angles and piezoelectric material and reveal the feasibility of broadband design for PEHs. We deduce the isogeometric formulation of PEHs based on Kirchhoff plate theory and Hamilton's principle. The optimization formulations are established with minimum energy factor or maximum output power considered, and the distributions of fiber angles and piezoelectric material are respectively defined by the Heaviside Penalization of Discrete Material Optimization (HPDMO) model and the Piezoelectric Material with Penalization (PEMAP) model. The numerical results show that there is only a slight difference in the optimized designs of fiber angles between the static load and harmonic load when the objective function is the minimum energy factor. Furthermore, taking maximum output power as the objective function, resistance has a substantial effect on the optimized distributions of fiber angles and piezoelectric material, and there is an optimal resistance making the output power of the optimized design increase 9 times compared with the initial model. More important, by combining the designability of composite material, the proposed method is extended to the broadband design of PEHs. It is concluded that the optimized design can not only generate two resonance peaks in the predetermined frequency range but also the second-order output power amplitude is 14 times higher than that of the benchmark model.},

The local search algorithm is applied to the scale factor in order to generate high quality solutions. Due to its structure, the computational cost of the local search is independent on the number of dimensions characterizing the problem and thus is a suitable component for large scale problems. The proposed algorithm has been compared with a standard DE and two other modern DE based metaheuristics for a varied set of test problems. Numerical results show that the DELS is an efficient and robust algorithm for highly multivariate optimization, and the employment of the local search to the scale factor is beneficial in order to detect solutions with a high quality, convergence speed and algorithmic robustness.},

Upon this basis, the modeling of the metamaterial is presented, using a two-level approach where the microscopic (with respect to the wires) susceptibility is derived by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation and the macroscopic (metamaterial) permittivity and permeability tensors are obtained by effective medium theory. Next, a review of FMNW microwave devices, such as circulators, isolators, and phase shifters, is provided, and the example of an FMNW dual-band edge-mode isolator is studied.

  abstract = {A powerful and versatile variational principle, allowing the estimation of the effective properties of nonlinear heterogeneous systems, has been introduced recently by Ponte Castaneda (1992). The central idea is to express the effective energy-density function of a given nonlinear composite in terms of an optimization problem involving the effective energy-density functions of linear comparison composites with similar microstructure. This permits the computation of bounds and estimates for the effective properties of given classes of nonlinear heterogeneous systems directly from well-known bounds and estimates for the effective properties of corresponding classes of linear comparison composites. In this paper, we review the variational principle and apply it to determine bounds and estimates for the effective properties of certain classes of nonlinear composite dielectrics with homogeneous, isotropic phases. Thus, nonlinear bounds of the Hashin-Shtrikman and Beran types are obtained for composites with overall isotropy and prescribed volume fractions (of the phases). While nonlinear (second-order) bounds of the Hashin-Shtrikman type have been obtained previously, in different form, by other methods, the nonlinear (higher-order) Beran bounds are the first of their type. Finally, exact estimates are also obtained for nonlinear composites with `sequentially layered' microstructures. These special composites, which have proved to be extremely useful in assessing the optimality of bounds for linear systems, are also useful, although to a lesser extent, in assessing the sharpness of the nonlinear bounds.}

Media with inverted populations of atomic and molecular energy levels have been predicted theoretically to exhibit a {$\chi$}(0) {$<$} 0 state, however the systems envisioned require reduced temperature, reduced pressure, and an external pump laser to maintain the population inversion. Further, the existence of {$\chi$}(0) {$<$} 0 has never been confirmed experimentally. Here, a completely different approach is taken to the question of {$\chi$}(0) {$<$} 0 and a design concept to achieve ``true'' {$\chi$}(0) {$<$} 0 is proposed based on active metamaterials with internal power sources. Two active metamaterial structures are fabricated that, despite still having their power sources implemented externally for reasons of practical convenience, provide evidence in support of the general concept. Effective values are readily achieved at room temperature and pressure and are tunable throughout the range of stability -1 {$<$} {$\chi$}(0) {$<$} 0, resulting in experimentally-determined magnitudes that are over one thousand times greater than those predicted previously. Since {$\chi$}(0) {$<$} 0 is the missing electric analog of diamagnetism, this work opens the door to new technological capabilities such as stable electrostatic levitation.},

This behaves as an effective medium, with strong artificial anisotropy, at a frequency corresponding to a flat band emerging from a Dirac-like point in transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. At this frequency, highly directive emission is predicted for an electric source placed inside this PC, and this artificial anisotropy can be shown to coincide with a change of character of the underlying effective equation from isotropic to unidirective, with coefficients of markedly different magnitudes appearing in the effective equation tensor. In transverse electric (TE) polarization, we note a second radical change of character of the underlying effective equation, this time from elliptic to hyperbolic, near a frequency at which a saddle point occurs in the corresponding dispersion curves. Delicate microwave experiments are performed in both polarizations for such a PC consisting of 80 rods, and we demonstrate that a directive emission in the form of a + (respectively, an X) is indeed seen experimentally at the predicted frequency 9.5 GHz in TM polarization (respectively, 5.9 GHz in TE polarization).

Photon collection efficiency, however, presents a major challenge for defect qubits in high refractive index host materials. Inverse-design optimization of photonic devices enables unprecedented flexibility in tailoring critical parameters of a spin-photon interface including spectral response, photon polarization, and collection mode. Further, the design process can incorporate additional constraints, such as fabrication tolerance and material processing limitations. Here, we design and demonstrate a compact hybrid gallium phosphide on diamond inverse-design planar dielectric structure coupled to single near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centers formed by implantation and annealing. We observe up to a 14-fold broadband enhancement in photon extraction efficiency, in close agreement with simulations. We expect that such inverse-designed devices will enable realization of scalable arrays of single-photon emitters, rapid characterization of new quantum emitters, efficient sensing, and heralded entanglement schemes.},

  abstract = {In our previous work, the similarity in resonant transmission properties for plasmonic and nonplasmonic 2D single slits can be realized by mapping their resonant wavelengths through waveguide dispersion. To further extend the mapping for nonresonant condition, complex reflection and transmission coefficients at the end faces of a semi-infinite slit are analyzed to reconstruct the whole transmission spectra. The complex reflection coefficients are found to be similar at the same effective wavelength for both the plasmonic and nonplasmonic cases. The spectrum reconstructed by a Fabry\&\#x2013;Perot model matches the transmission spectrum of a nonplasmonic slit and can be transformed into that of a plasmonic case by wavelength stretching with plasmonic waveguide dispersion. The transmission cross section is bounded by \&\#x3BB;/(\&\#x3C0;d). Width-dependent redshifts of the transmission spectrum are associated with effective capacitances at the slit end faces. The same mapping method applies for a single slit with substrate or periodic structure. Furthermore, the optical property of a plasmonic slit can be achieved by a nonplasmonic slit via dimensional scaling. The focusing lens effect of a plasmonic slit array can be mimicked by a nonplasmonic slit array with dimensional scaling. The unified transmission properties of plasmonic and nonplasmonic 2D single slits can simplify the design of slit structures for plasmonic applications.},

However, it is no trivial task to determine whether a computational framework is performing efficiently or is scalable. The aim of this paper is to present various strategies for better understanding the performance of any parallel computational frameworks for solving PDEs. Important performance issues that negatively impact time-to-solution are discussed, and we propose a performance spectrum analysis that can enhance one's understanding of critical aforementioned performance issues. As proof of concept, we examine commonly used finite element simulation packages and software and apply the performance spectrum to quickly analyze the performance and scalability across various hardware platforms, software implementations, and numerical discretizations. It is shown that the proposed performance spectrum is a versatile performance model that is not only extendable to more complex PDEs such as hydrostatic ice sheet flow equations but also useful for understanding hardware performance in a massively parallel computing environment. Potential applications and future extensions of this work are also discussed.},

It is now necessary to determine the dielectric permittivity values of such films directly because of the growing use of thin films in integrated circuitry. Two different types of instrumentation were utilized and new techniques were developed so that the dielectric permittivity values can be determined accurately at microwave as well as at millimeter wave and terahertz frequencies. The Agilent 8510C vector network analyzer was employed together with a specially designed slotted cavity for the X-band microwave measurements of thin films. A step size of 500 nano meter for the mirror movement was implemented for the dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy (DFTS) technique to provide higher resolution phase reproduction leading to the determination of the real part of dielectric permittivity values for thin films as a continuous function of frequency from about 60 GHz to 1,000 GHz. Data for one mil (25 {$\mu$}m) thin Teflon, Mylar and black polyester are shown.},

We demonstrate that, for a specified accuracy of 0.5\%, the speedup of using semi-implicit Fourier-spectral method, when compared with the explicit finite-difference schemes, is at least two orders of magnitude in two dimensions, and close to three orders of magnitude in three dimensions.

However, the existing structures commonly compose of a regular shape of inclusions for the limited arrangements in the unit cell. This paper develops a topology optimization approach for designing novel structures of acoustic TIs. With the mechanism of acoustic TIs based on the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), topology optimization first seeks sonic crystals (SCs) with double Dirac cones of dipolar and quadrupolar modes. Then, topology optimization creates topological trivial and non-trivial SCs by breaking the double Dirac cones, which freely assemble into acoustic TIs. The optimized structures exhibit the typical functionalities of acoustic TIs, the robust propagation and spin-locked unidirectional transmission of topological edge states, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

These range from laboratory microscopes to optical fibres and even consumer products, such as photography cameras. Conventional methods of engineering optical dispersion are based on altering material composition, but this process is time-consuming and difficult, and the resulting optical performance is often limited to a certain bandwidth. Recent advances in nanofabrication have led to high-quality metasurfaces with the potential to perform at a level comparable to their state-of-the-art refractive counterparts. In this Review, we introduce the underlying physical principles of metasurface optical elements (with a focus on metalenses) and, drawing on various works in the literature, discuss how their constituent nanostructures can be designed with a highly customizable effective index of refraction that incorporates both phase and dispersion engineering. These metasurfaces can serve as an essential component for achromatic optics with unprecedented levels of performance across a broad bandwidth or provide highly customized, engineered chromatic behaviour in instruments such as miniature aberration-corrected spectrometers. We identify some key areas in which these achromatic or dispersion-engineered metasurface optical elements could be useful and highlight some future challenges, as well as promising ways to overcome them.},

The underlying principle is that the volume fraction of the inclusion scatterers can be varied spatially so as to control the effective permittivity for the desired permittivity profile. Specifically, to achieve desired volume fraction values, simple cubic packing, hexagonal close packing and random packing methods were used for scatterer distribution. The proposed analysis features the plasmonic inclusions as a rational alternative for dielectric inclusions to produce a desired effective value of the permittivity in optics. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme by employing it to design and simulate Luneburg lens (both in microwave and optics) for beam steering applications. The design leads to polarisation independent functionality in the plane tangent to the lens and yields high antenna gain. The scheme provides a useful means to realize many disruptive applications ranging from the microwaves to optics.},

To alleviate such issues, we present a machine learning approach that combines CS and convolutional neural network (CNN) for radar imaging. This CS based CNN (CS-CNN) method maintains good characteristics of CS methods, such as sparse sampling and high resolving power but is free from time-consuming computer optimization and demanding spaces for data storage. In the meantime, it is also robust to environment changes like noise, target sparsity and sampling rate. We have conducted extensive computer simulations for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Finally, we experimentally validate the technique with a demonstration of stable high resolution imaging using a sparse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array where traditional imaging methods suffer from serious grating lobes. This approach is generic and can be easily extended to other applications of electromagnetic imaging and sensing.},

Metamaterials composed of a single-slit Helmholtz resonator arranged in two-dimensional square lattice are investigated. We rotate a portion of the resonator so that the adjacent resonators in a {$\Gamma$}X direction have a twist angle of {$\varphi$}. For the system with {$\varphi$}=180{$\circ$}, the coupling interaction produces the symmetric coupled mode in in-phase oscillation and the antisymmetric coupled mode in out-of-phase oscillation. This acoustic analog of ``hybridization effect'' leads to a sharp transparency window in the extended locally-resonant forbidden gap, which is analogous to the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency. Such coupled resonant modes may have potential applications in sound wave manipulations such as acoustic filtering and imaging.},

However, the lack of robust inverse design approaches to identify promising candidate materials without exploring the entire design space causes a fundamental bottleneck.

This ML-based inverse design approach uses backpropagation to calculate the analytical gradients of an objective function with respect to design variables. This inverse design approach is capable of overcoming local minima traps by using backpropagation to provide rapid calculations of gradient information and running millions of optimizations with different initial values. Furthermore, an active learning strategy is adopted in the inverse design approach to improve the performance of candidate materials and reduce the amount of training data needed to do so. Compared to passive learning, the active learning strategy is capable of generating better designs and reducing the amount of training data by at least an order-of-magnitude in the case study on composite materials. The inverse design approach is compared with conventional gradient-based topology optimization and gradient-free genetic algorithms and the pros and cons of each method are discussed when applied to materials discovery and design problems.},

Since the operators (e.g. crossover, mutation, selection) in most traditional EAs are developed on the basis of fixed heuristic rules or strategies, they are unable to learn the structures or properties of the problems to be optimized. To equip the EAs with learning abilities, recently, various model-based evolutionary algorithms (MBEAs) have been proposed. This survey briefly reviews some representative MBEAs by considering three different motivations of using models. First, the most commonly seen motivation of using models is to estimate the distribution of the candidate solutions. Second, in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, one motivation of using models is to build the inverse models from the objective space to the decision space. Third, when solving computationally expensive problems, models can be used as surrogates of the fitness functions. Based on the review, some further discussions are also given.},

  abstract = {Various electromagnetic (EM) structures become more complex and often have increasing degrees of design freedom. Classical optimization methods require numerous simulation trials of different parameter combinations, which leads to a low design efficiency. To address this problem, an efficient EM structure optimization algorithm which combines differential evolution (DE) with machine learning technology is proposed in this paper. By partly substituting electromagnetic (EM) solver, Kriging model predicts the responses and uncertainties of each individual after differential evolution. The exploration and exploitation of the searching can be adjusted by the constitution and prescreening of the population before and after evolution. This algorithm is applied to optimize the resonant frequencies of an E-shaped antenna with 6 variables. Comparing with the other optimization methods, the number of EM simulations needed is reduced by about 80\%.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), portable electronics and wireless sensing networks has raised the need for a new class of devices with self-powering capabilities. Vibration-based piezoelectric energy harvesters provide a very promising solution, as a result of their capability of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy through the direct piezoelectric effect. However, the identification of fast, accurate methods and rational criteria for the design of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices still poses a challenge. In this work, a level set-based topology optimization approach is proposed to synthesize mechanical energy harvesting devices for self-powered micro systems. The energy harvester design problem is reformulated as a variational problem based on the concept of topology optimization, where the optimal geometry is sought by maximizing the energy conversion efficiency of the device. To ensure computational efficiency, the shape gradient of the energy conversion efficiency is analytically derived using the material time derivative approach and the adjoint variable method. A design velocity field is then constructed using the steepest descent method, which is further integrated into level set methods. The reconciled level set (RLS) method is employed to solve multi-material shape and topology optimization problems, using the Merriman\textendash Bence\textendash Osher (MBO) operator. Designs with both single and multiple materials are presented, which constitute improvements with respect to existing energy harvesting designs.},

Hence, researchers and engineers have endeavoured to develop efficient optimisation techniques that can solve practical MIMO designs with affordable costs. In this contribution, we demonstrate that particle swarm optimisation (PSO) offers an efficient means for aiding MIMO transceiver designs. Specifically, we consider PSO-aided semi-blind joint maximum likelihood channel estimation and data detection for MIMO receiver, and we investigate PSO-based minimum bit-error-rate multiuser transmission for MIMO systems. In both these two MIMO applications, the PSO-aided approach attains an optimal design solution with a significantly lower complexity than the existing state-of-the-art scheme.},

It starts with a brief introduction to the thermodynamics of coupled electromechanical systems and the Landau description of ferroelectric transitions in homogeneous ferroelectric single crystals. The thermodynamic potentials of a homogeneous crystal under different mechanical boundary conditions are presented, including the thin-film boundary conditions. The phase-field approach to inhomogeneous systems containing domain structures is then outlined. It describes a domain structure using the spatial distribution of spontaneous polarization. The evolution of a domain structure towards equilibrium is driven by the reduction in the total-free energy of an inhomogeneous domain structure including the chemical driving force, domain wall energy, electrostatic energy as well as elastic energy. A number of examples are discussed, including phase transitions and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films and superlattices. It is demonstrated that using a set of independently measured thermodynamic parameters for the corresponding bulk single crystals, the phase-field approach is able to quantitatively predict not only the strain effect on phase transition temperatures but also the correct ferroelectric domain structures for a given strain and temperature.},

This study reports a subwavelength reconfigurable Huygens' metasurface realized by loading it with controllable active elements. The proposed design provides a unified solution to the aforementioned challenges of real-time local reconfigurability of efficient Huygens' metasurfaces. As one exemplary demonstration, a reconfigurable metalens at the microwave frequencies is experimentally realized, which, to the best of the knowledge, demonstrates for the first time that multiple and complex focal spots can be controlled simultaneously at distinct spatial positions and reprogrammable in any desired fashion, with fast response time and high efficiency.

The design of on-demand graphene-based metamaterials often calls for the solution of a complex inverse problem within a small sampling space, which highly depends on the rich experiences from researchers of nanophotonics. Conventional optimization algorithms could be used for this inverse design, but they converge to local optimal solutions and take significant computational costs with increased nanostructure parameters. Here, we establish a deep learning method based on an adaptive batch-normalized neural network, aiming to implement smart and rapid inverse design for graphene-based metamaterials with on-demand optical responses. This method allows a quick converging speed with high precision and low computational consumption. As typical complex proof-of-concept examples, the optical metamaterials consisting of graphene/dielectric alternating multilayers are chosen to demonstrate the validity of our design paradigm. Our method demonstrates a high prediction accuracy of over 95\% after very few training epochs. A universal programming package is developed to achieve the design goals of graphene-based metamaterials with low absorption and near unity absorption, respectively. Our work may find important design applications in the field of nanoscale photonics based on graphene and other 2D materials.},

Numerous efforts have been made to maximize the enhancement factor through optimizing the size, shape, and spatial arrangement of metallic nanostructures with simple geometries, such as disk, triangle, and rod. This work implements topology optimization to inversely design a metallic nanoparticle dimer with the goal of optimizing the near-field enhancement factor in its sub-10 nm gap. By optimizing the material layout within a given design space, the topology optimization algorithm results in a plasmonic nanodimer of two heart-shaped particles having both convex and concave features. Full-wave electromagnetic analysis reveals that the largest near-field enhancement in the heart-shaped nanoparticle dimer is originated from the greatest concentration of surface charges at the nano-heart apex. Inversely designed heart-, bowtie-, and disk-shaped nanodimers are fabricated by using focused helium ion beam milling with a ``sketch and peel'' strategy, and their near-field enhancement performances are characterized with nonlinear optical spectroscopies at the single-particle level. Indeed, the heart-shaped nanodimer exhibits much stronger signal intensities than the other two structures. The present work corroborates the validity and effectiveness of topology optimization-based inverse design in achieving desired plasmonic functionalities.},

By stacking two cholesteric liquid crystal (ChLC) films, the defect mode due to the introduction of a twist defect was considered in both cases of chiral structures with constant pitch and spatially varying pitch. Two types of linear pitch gradients for achieving a broadband reflection were analysed, and the number of chiral pitches required for establishing the stop band was simulated. The effect of a finite sample thickness on the energy density distribution of the defect mode and on the required polarization of the incident light to excite the defect mode was studied. In both cases of constant pitch and spatially varying pitch, an unusual crossover behaviour in reflection at the defect resonance wavelength of a single circularly polarized mode appears when the structure thickness increases beyond a specific value. The energy distribution inside the sample also reveals the unusual distribution. Two different resonance wavelengths can be created by a twist defect in the ChLC composite film with linearly varying pitch, while only one resonance wavelength can be created in the identical film with constant pitch.},

This subject topic will be discussed in its simplest terms so that it can be easily understood by a larger community of researchers. A new way of motivating Hamiltonian mechanics is presented together with a novel way of deriving the quantum equations of motion for electromagnetics. All equations of motion here are derived using the generalized Lorenz gauge with vector and scalar potential formulation. It is well known that the vector potential manifests itself in the Aharonov-Bohm effect. By advocating this formulation, it is expected that more quantum effects can be easily incorporated in electromagnetic calculations. Using a similar approach, the quantization of electromagnetic fields in reciprocal, anisotropic, inhomogeneous media is presented.

  abstract = {In this work, quantization of electromagnetic fields in a general anisotropic inhomogeneous media is considered. First, the classical Hamiltonian is derived. Once the Hamiltonian is derived, with it the classical equations of motion follow. Next, the fields are elevated to become quantum operators, for which conjugate pairs are endowed with commutators. Since as previously shown, such commutators induce functional derivatives, the quantum equations of motion can be easily derived. Next, the mode decomposition of the fields is demonstrated. Upon substitution into the classical Hamiltonian, each mode then behaves like a simple harmonic oscillator. These oscillators can then be elevated to become quantum harmonic oscillators. Both the traveling wave modes and the standing wave modes are discussed. Furthermore, the longitudinal modes are described. Finally, the case of impressed sources are considered, with the corresponding Hamiltonian and field quantization. The Green's functions for the linear system are presented. Finally, the quantum Maxwell's equations are derived. A short discussion on field-atom interaction is given.},

  abstract = {An open system is not conservative because energy can escape to the outside. As a result, the time-evolution operator is not Hermitian in the usual sense and the eigenfunctions (factorized solutions in space and time) are no longer normal modes but quasinormal modes (QNMs) whose frequencies {$\omega$} are complex. Qausinormal-mode analysis has been a powerful tool for investigating open systems. Previous studies have been mostly system specific, and use a few QNMs to provide approximate descriptions. Here the authors review developments that lead to a unifying treatment. The formulation leads to a mathematical structure in close analogy to that in conservative, Hermitian systems. Hence many of the mathematical tools for the latter can be transcribed. Emphasis is placed on those cases in which the QNMs form a complete set and thus give an exact description of the dynamics. In situations where the QNMs are not complete, the ``remainder'' is characterized. Applications to optics in microspheres and to gravitational waves from black holes are given as examples. The second-quantized theory is sketched. Directions for further development are outlined.}

Here, we experimentally demonstrate a polarization-insensitive holographic Huygens' metasurface based on dielectric resonant meta-atoms capable of complex wavefront control at telecommunication wavelengths. Our metasurface produces a hologram image in the far-field with 82\% transmittance efficiency and 40\% imaging efficiency. Such efficient complex wavefront control shows that Huygens' metasurfaces based on resonant dielectric meta-atoms are a big step toward practical applications of metasurfaces in wavefront design related technologies, including computer-generated holograms, ultrathin optics, security, and data storage devices.},

The tutorial presents a step-by-step guide for deriving the continuous constrained optimization problem forming the foundation of the TopOpt method, using a cylindrical metalens design problem as an example. It demonstrates the effect and necessity of applying a number of auxiliary tools in the design process to ensure good numerical modeling practice and to achieve physically realizable designs.

The scheme is shown to exhibit superior properties in the ultraviolet to low infrared wavelength regime, compared to simple linear and inverse interpolation schemes for {$\epsilon$}r used in the literature. The superior properties are demonstrated with optimization examples and a physical motivation is provided. Finally, the capability of the scheme is demonstrated by designing a nano-scale Ag antenna-strip providing approximately a 1200 fold spatially-localized enhancement of the electric energy, corresponding to a more than 600\% performance improvement over a topology optimized reference design from the literature.},

This finding suggests that the final designs are near-optimal under the given design constraints. Secondarily, by stopping the design procedure after the same fixed number of design iterations for all initial guesses, it shows that the designed photonic cavity is sensitive towards certain small perturbations of their geometry, stressing the need for utilizing robust optimization techniques and imposing fabrication conforming length-scales in the cavity geometries.},

  abstract = {The main challenge in the antenna or laser array design is to find the element distribution that best meets the optimal performance for broadband emission and large angle beam steering. In the past, the design strategy was restricted to arrays with periodic, aperiodic, and random distributions, which are characterized by several fundamental limitations related to the operating frequency, the power consumption that arises from interelement interference, and the computation time required during the random optimization process. Furthermore, the interelement spacing has a lower or upper bound due to the elements' physical dimensions and the former prohibits the use of the aforementioned element distributions for small operating wavelengths, whereas the latter induces high-order grating lobes. We prove that hyperuniform disorder is an array element distribution evolving through natural selection processes that warrants a disordered solution to the array design when this is treated as a packing problem. We theoretically and experimentally report that the array with hyperuniform disorder exhibits extraordinary directive emission and scanning features, while being scalable for extra-large arrays without any additional computational effort.},

The validity of this approach is demonstrated by three examples. We further show that the Dirac cones of accidental degeneracy have the same properties as the symmetry-induced Dirac cones, such as finite group velocity and pseudo-diffusive transmission.

Such ultrathin devices confer reflection-less transmission through impedance-mismatched interfaces with arbitrary wavefront shapes. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate a three-layer antireflection metasurface that achieves an intriguing phenomenon: the simultaneous elimination of the reflection and refraction effects on a dielectric surface. Incident waves transmit straightly through the dielectric surface as if the surface turns invisible. We further demonstrate a wide variety of applications such as invisible curved surfaces, ``cloaking'' of dielectric objects, reflection-less negative refraction and flat axicons on dielectric-air interfaces, etc. The coalescence of antireflection and wavefront controllability in the deep subwavelength scale brings new opportunities for advanced interface optics with high efficiency and great flexibility.},

In order to prove that this method converges for the p-polarization state, we studied several different but related scattering problems. The imposition of generalized non-trapping conditions allowed us to prove a-priori estimates for these problems. To do this, we proved a Rellich identity and used density arguments to extend the estimates to more general problems. These a-priori estimates were then used to analyze the hybrid method. We obtained convergence rates with respect to two different parameters, the first being a slice thickness indicative of spatial discretization in the depth dimension, the second being the number of terms retained in the Rayleigh\textendash Bloch expansions of the electric and magnetic field phasors with respect to the other dimension. Testing with a numerical example revealed faster convergence than our analysis predicted. The hybrid method does not suffer from the Gibbs phenomenon seen with the standard RCWA.},

However, the diffraction limit prevents terahertz radiation ({$\lambda$}\,{$\approx$}\,0.01\textendash 3\,mm) from being focused to the nanometre length scale of modern devices. In response to this challenge, terahertz scanning probe microscopy techniques based on coupling terahertz radiation to subwavelength probes such as sharp tips have been developed. These probes enhance and confine the light, improving the spatial resolution of terahertz experiments by up to six orders of magnitude. In this Review, we survey terahertz scanning probe microscopy techniques that achieve spatial resolution on the scale of micrometres to \aa ngstr\"oms, with particular emphasis on their overarching approaches and underlying probing mechanisms. Finally, we forecast the next steps in the field.},

  abstract = {Multi-objective genetic Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems use multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to generate a set of fuzzy rule-based systems of the TS type with different trade-offs between, generally, complexity/interpretability and accuracy. The application of these algorithms requires a large number of TS system generations and evaluations.When we deal with high dimensional data sets, these tasks can be very time-consuming, thus making an adequate exploration of the search space very problematic. In this chapter, we propose two techniques to speed up generation and evaluation of TS systems. The first technique aims to speed up the identification of the consequent parameters of the TS rules, one of the most timeconsuming phases in TS generation. The application of this technique produces as a side-effect a decoupling of the rules in the TS system. Thus, modifications in a rule do not affect the other rules. Exploiting this property, the second technique proposes to store specific values used in the parents, so as to reuse them in the offspring and to avoid wasting time. We show the advantages of the proposed method in terms of computing time saving and improved search space exploration through two examples of multi-objective genetic learning of compact and accurate TS-type fuzzy systems for a high dimensional data set in the regression and time series forecasting domains.},

This will likely require design algorithms surpassing the capability of human intuition. For the adjoint method, this requires explicitly deriving gradients, which is sometimes challenging for certain photonics problems. Existing techniques also comprise a patchwork of application-specific algorithms, each focused in scope and scatterer type. Here, we leverage algorithmic differentiation as used in artificial neural networks, treating photonic design parameters as trainable weights, optical sources as inputs, and encapsulating device performance in the loss function. By solving a complex, degenerate eigenproblem and formulating rigorous coupled-wave analysis as a computational graph, we support both arbitrary, parameterized scatterers and topology optimization. With iteration times below the cost of two forward simulations typical of adjoint methods, we generate multilayer, multifunctional, and aperiodic meta-optics. As an open-source platform adaptable to other algorithms and problems, we enable fast and flexible meta-optical design.},

  abstract = {A complete methodology, based on a two-scale asymptotic approach, that enables the homogenisation of elastic lattices at non-zero frequencies is developed. Elastic lattices are distinguished from scalar lattices in that two or more types of coupled waves exist, even at low frequencies. Such a theory enables the determination of effective material properties at both low and high frequencies. The theoretical framework is developed for the propagation of waves through lattices of arbitrary geometry and dimension. The asymptotic approach provides a method through which the dispersive properties of lattices at frequencies near standing waves can be described; the theory accurately describes both the dispersion curves and the response of the lattice. The leading order solution is expressed as a product between the standing wave solution and the long-scale envelope functions that are eigensolutions of the homogenised partial differential equation. The general theory is supplemented by a pair of illustrative examples for two archetypal classes of two-dimensional elastic lattices. The efficiency of the asymptotic approach in accurately describing several interesting phenomena is demonstrated, including dynamic anisotropy and Dirac cones. A significant advantage of the method exposited herein is that it allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the leading order asymptotic solutions and effective material properties, even for complex systems; the methodology allows for greater physical understanding of the behaviour of the system than is usually the case for purely numerical homogenisation schemes.},

It is shown that, in contrast with the Helmholtz equation, the general form of the partial differential equation is not invariant with respect to the cloaking transformation. The significant result of this paper is the analysis of the transformed equation and its interpretation in the framework of the linear theory of pre-stressed plates. The paper provides a formal framework for transformation elastodynamics as applied to elastic plates. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for designing a broadband square cloak for flexural waves, which employs a regularised push-out transformation. Illustrative numerical examples show high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed cloaking algorithm. In particular, a physical configuration involving a perturbation of an interference pattern generated by two coherent sources is presented. It is demonstrated that the perturbation produced by a cloaked defect is negligibly small even for such a delicate interference pattern.},

These provide benchmarks upon which asymptotic techniques can be tested and are also of interest in their own right. Two specific cases are considered: a generalized two-dimensional Mathieu-like equation and that of piecewise constant checkerboard media; the latter provides an ideal paradigm as the resulting dispersion relations are explicit and give virtually the only two-dimensional, non-trivial, dispersion relations for Bloch waves. The dispersion relations demonstrate many features of topical interest such as stop-bands and flat dispersion curves corresponding to slow light. Illustrative calculations show all-angle-negative refraction at higher frequencies than normal, so lensing and cloaking effects are obtained. The separable structures are used to illustrate the efficacy of homogenization theory, near the edges of the Brillouin zone, when the wavelength and microstructural lengthscales are of similar order. Conventional homogenization is widely assumed to be ineffective for modeling photonic crystals as it is limited to low frequencies when the wavelength is long relative to the microstructural lengthscales. Here high frequency homogenization theory, which is free of the conventional limitations, is used to generate effective partial differential equations on a macroscale, that have the microscale embedded within them through averaged quantities.},

This general solution is then used to calculate the effective properties. Thus this four-phase checkerboard encapsulates many limiting and special cases; as a starting point we develop a concise closed-form solution to a basic problem involving four joined quarter planes each of a different resistivity. Subsequent manipulations yield solutions to problems posed in increasingly convoluted domains while retaining the essentially simple structure found for joined quarter planes.},

We explore the implications of an asymptotic approach to uncover the underlying structure behind these phenomena. Conventional homogenization is widely assumed to be ineffective for modeling photonic crystals as it is limited to low frequencies when the wavelength is long relative to the microstructural length scales. Here a recently developed high-frequency homogenization (HFH) theory [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A466, 2341 (2010)] is used to generate effective partial differential equations on a macroscale, which have the microscale embedded within them through averaged quantities, for checkerboard media. For physical applications, ultrarefraction is well described by an equivalent homogeneous medium with an effective refractive index given by the HFH procedure, the decay behavior of localized defect modes is characterized completely, and frequencies at which AANR occurs are all determined analytically. We illustrate our findings numerically with a finite-size checkerboard using finite elements, and we emphasize that conventional effective medium theory cannot handle such high frequencies. Finally, we look at light confinement effects in finite-size checkerboards behaving as open resonators when the condition for AANR is met [J. Phys. Condens. Matter 15, 6345 (2003)].},

In periodic media, there are frequencies for which standing waves, periodic with the period or double period of the cell, on the microscale emerge. These frequencies do not belong to the low-frequency range of validity covered by the classical homogenization theory, which motivates our use of the term `high-frequency homogenization' when perturbing about these standing waves. The resulting long-wave equations are deduced only explicitly dependent upon the macroscale, with the microscale represented by integral quantities. These equations accurately reproduce the behaviour of the Bloch mode spectrum near the edges of the Brillouin zone, hence yielding an explicit way for homogenizing periodic media in the vicinity of `cell resonances'. The similarity of such model equations to high-frequency long wavelength asymptotics, for homogeneous acoustic and elastic waveguides, valid in the vicinities of thickness resonances is emphasized.

The interplay of position-dependent stochastic coupling and size distribution of antennas determines the optical properties of such arrays as a function of mean/standard deviation of diameter and minimum separation.

Using the Berreman 4\texttimes 4 matrix formalism, we numerically obtain the transmission spectrum at normal and oblique light incidence as a function of width and the position of the deformation. Our results reveal that a pair of resonant modes emerges inside the main stop band of the transmission spectrum as the width of the deformation becomes comparable to the helical pitch length. The mechanism behind the emergence of the resonant modes is discussed. The case of a pitch profile with multiple Gaussian deformations is also analyzed. At this configuration, a crossover from single to multiple band-gap pattern can be observed in the transmission spectrum, depending on the deformation parameters.},

These techniques expand the transverse EM fields in Bloch modes in each strata unit-cell, but do not rigorously enforce EM boundary conditions at interior material interfaces which gives rise to slow convergence of the polarized S-matrix values with increasing Fourier series truncation order. We present a normal vector (NV) Fourier modal scattering approach that uses the gradient of the real permittivity in the unit-cell to generate a local NV resulting in anisotropic eigenmodes of Maxwell's equations that satisfy interior boundary conditions. The convergence of this expansion method is examine numerically for our analytic NV derived from planar primitive geometry elements for various example structures. The Fourier modal NV method is then derived for the planar cavity boundary value problem and the cavity eigenmodes and density of states is determined from the analytic continuation of the secular determinant. A complete scattering method for highly dispersive materials and sub-wavelength structures has been presented that is adaptable to planar EM cavity problems using fluctuation electrodynamics formalism.},

  abstract = {In many real world network problems several objectives have to be optimized simultaneously. To solve such problems, it is often appropriate to use the multi-criterion minimum spanning tree (MCMST) model, a combinatorial optimization problem that has been shown to be NP-Hard. In Pareto Optimization of the model no polynomial time algorithm is known to find the Pareto front for all instances of the MCMST problem. Researchers have therefore developed deterministic and evolutionary algorithms. However, these exhibit a number of shortcomings such as lack of scalability and large CPU times. Therefore, the hybridised Knowledge-based Evolutionary Algorithm (KEA) has been proposed, which does not have the limitations of previous algorithms because of its speed, its scalability to more than 500 nodes in the bi-criterion case and scalability to the multicriterion case, and its ability to find both the supported and non-supported optimal solutions. KEA is faster and more efficient than NSGA-II in terms of spread and number of solutions found. The only weakness of KEA is the dominated middle of its Pareto front. In order to overcome this deficiency, a number of modifications have been tested including KEA-M, KEA-G and KEA-W. Experimental results show that when time is expensive KEA is preferable to all other algorithms tested.},

It is expected that it might become an unavoidable engineering tool for many new rising technologies such as the additive manufacturing or metal 3D printing as addressed recently in the literature. During the last fifteen years, several TO methods have been developed for optimizing thermal systems based on conductive, convective and conjugate heat transfer. These numerical methods and tools are dispersed in the literature, and there are no enough comparisons between them which makes one doubts their real capabilities in finding really optimal designs. This paper presents a review about TO design methods that have been developed during the last 15\textendash 20years to design optimal heat transfer systems. Each numerical method is presented briefly with an emphasize on its advantages, disadvantages, limitations and perspectives. Finally, this review shows that TO today is not yet a robust numerical design technique for finding optimal designs of thermal systems.},

We use analytical models to determine the hybridization of graphene surface plasmon and ferroelectric LiNbO3 type I and type II reststrahlen hyperbolic phonon\textendash polariton. The variation of the chemical potential of graphene and the thickness of the ferroelectric layer results in several distinct features. Flipping the group velocity, strongly coupled hybrid hyperbolic surface plasmon\textendash polaritons, and surface plasmon\textendash polariton mode exists for the same momentum at different frequencies. The group velocity sign reversal for both a single-graphene- and double-graphene-integrated system depends on the thickness of the hyperbolic layer and the chemical potential of graphene. Comparative analysis of Purcell radiation is presented for a quantum emitter positioned at different locations between ferroelectric and graphene-integrated ferroelectric layers, revealing that this system can support strong spontaneous emission that can be modulated with the graphene chemical potential. Changing the chemical potential through selective voltage biasing demonstrates a substantial increase or decrease in the decay rate for spontaneous emission. Further analysis of the emission phenomenon shows a dependence on factors, such as the relative radiating source position and the thickness of the ferroelectric film. These characteristics make graphene\textendash ferroelectric materials promising candidates to modify the light\textendash matter interaction at the low terahertz ranges.},

Although enhanced transmission windows are dominated by Fabry-Perot cavity modes localized inside the slits, the periodicity introduces surface modes that can either enhance or inhibit light transmission. We thus illustrate the interaction between cavity modes and surface modes in both finite and infinite arrays of slits. In particular we study a grating that clearly separates surface plasmon effects from Wood-Rayleigh anomalies. The periodicity of the grating induces a strong plasmonic band gap that inhibits coupling to the cavity modes for frequencies near the center of the band gap, thereby reducing the transmission of the grating. Strong field localization at the high energy plasmonic band edge enhances coupling to the cavity modes while field localization at the low energy band edge leads to weak cavity coupling and reduced transmission.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a topology optimization procedure for three-dimensional electromagnetic waves with an edge element-based finite-element method. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, three-dimensional electromagnetic waves must include an additional divergence-free condition for the field variables. The edge element-based finite-element method is used to both discretize the wave equations and enforce the divergence-free condition. For wave propagation described in terms of the magnetic field in the widely used class of non-magnetic materials, the divergence-free condition is imposed on the magnetic field. This naturally leads to a nodal topology optimization method. When wave propagation is described using the electric field, the divergence-free condition must be imposed on the electric displacement. In this case, the material in the design domain is assumed to be piecewise homogeneous to impose the divergence-free condition on the electric field. This results in an element-wise topology optimization algorithm. The topology optimization problems are regularized using a Helmholtz filter and a threshold projection method and are analysed using a continuous adjoint method. In order to ensure the applicability of the filter in the element-wise topology optimization version, a regularization method is presented to project the nodal into an element-wise physical density variable.},

  abstract = {A new phase-field modeling framework with an emphasis on performance, flexibility, and ease of use is presented. Foremost among the strategies employed to fulfill these objectives are the use of a matrix-free finite element method and a modular, application-centric code structure. This approach is implemented in the new open-source PRISMS-PF framework. Its performance is enabled by the combination of a matrix-free variant of the finite element method with adaptive mesh refinement, explicit time integration, and multilevel parallelism. Benchmark testing with a particle growth problem shows PRISMS-PF with adaptive mesh refinement and higher-order elements to be up to 12 times faster than a finite difference code employing a second-order-accurate spatial discretization and first-order-accurate explicit time integration. Furthermore, for a two-dimensional solidification benchmark problem, the performance of PRISMS-PF meets or exceeds that of phase-field frameworks that focus on implicit/semi-implicit time stepping, even though the benchmark problem's small computational size reduces the scalability advantage of explicit time-integration schemes. PRISMS-PF supports an arbitrary number of coupled governing equations. The code structure simplifies the modification of these governing equations by separating their definition from the implementation of the numerical methods used to solve them. As part of its modular design, the framework includes functionality for nucleation and polycrystalline systems available in any application to further broaden the phenomena that can be used to study. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated with examples from several common types of phase-field simulations, including coarsening subsequent to spinodal decomposition, solidification, precipitation, grain growth, and corrosion.},

  abstract = {Science and technologies based on terahertz frequency electromagnetic radiation (100 GHz\textendash 30 THz) have developed rapidly over the last 30 years. For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to `real world' applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established. We also feel that this review should serve as a useful guide for government and funding agencies.},

Physical insight is presented into the optimal choice of locations where masses should be added and the results of several numerical examples are provided to highlight this and other features of how band-gaps can be created and located at desired frequency ranges. The effect of the skew angle of the underlying grid structure is also explored, as are mathematical refinements of the modelling of the beam elements and the rotational inertia of the added masses. A scaling feature between the size of the reducible and the irreducible reference cell is exploited and the manner in which this can simplify optimization approaches is discussed.},

The effective permeability depends on the layout of copper, and the subject of the topology optimization problem is to find layouts that result in negative (real) permeability at a prescribed frequency. A SIMP-like model is invoked to represent the conductivity of regions of intermediate density. A number of different filtering strategies are invoked to facilitate convergence to binary solutions. Examples of designs for S-band applications are presented for illustration. New metamaterial concepts are uncovered, beyond the classical split-ring inspired layouts.},

Due to the excellent thermoelectric properties of BST, different relative permittivities can be obtained at different temperatures. With this ability, the passband frequency of the FSS can be tuned by changing the temperature of the BST thin film. The metallic element array of the FSS is designed using the metamaterial method. A convenient method for thermal control is proposed that uses micro-fabricated electric heating wires; these can provide different temperatures by altering the input electric current. Full wave simulations show good performance of thermally tunable frequency selective transmission at THz frequencies. The proposed FSS is then fabricated and measured. The experimental results agree well with the simulation. By changing the temperature of the BST thin film, the passband can be tuned from 0.826 THz to 0.905 THz. This work proposes a THz tunable FSS based on BST thin film, which promotes connections between ferroelectric films and tunable THz functional devices.},

The difficulty in understanding what happens comes from not being able to 'see' clearly what happens experimentally. Sub-THz spectrometry based on high resolution systems (vector network analysers) can record vibrational modes from absorption spectra. Antenna engineering presents biology with a means for understanding their molecular systems as equivalent electrical circuits. From the measured frequency absorption spectra of the protein we seek to learn from the protein's vibrational structure, its folding trajectory. Finally we will look at how deliberate, targeted, excitation of specific vibrational modes of molecules can be used to effect new reaction pathways to create an intelligent and engineered approach to RF-assisted chemistry.},

  abstract = {We present a ray theory for modeling elastic wave propagation in spatially graded mechanical metamaterials. Wave propagation in periodic metamaterials has been well studied, motivated by their beneficial wave steering and bandgap properties. By contrast, comparably little work has explored wave propagation in spatially graded metamaterials despite the increased design opportunities, largely due to the lack of efficient modeling techniques. We develop a ray theory to model waves in graded metamaterials based on high-frequency asymptotics and the assumption of local periodicity. This work builds upon the well-developed ray theories that are fundamental in a wide range of fields, from optics to seismology. Our derivations produce a practical framework for computing approximate wave fields in graded metamaterials. Ray trajectories are computed by independently solving a system of ordinary differential equations for each ray, requiring only knowledge of local dispersion relations throughout the metamaterial, which vary smoothly in space due to grading. Equations for the wave amplitude along rays are also derived in the two-dimensional setting. We show that the form of the ray tracing equations are nearly identical to those for smooth solids in seismic ray theory, with the primary difference being the dispersion relations. A numerical framework for computing ray solutions is demonstrated on a mass\textendash spring network with analytical dispersion relations as well as a truss metamaterial that requires the numerical evaluation of dispersion relations. Through these examples, we demonstrate that ray theory provides an efficient means of studying the fascinating behavior of waves in graded metamaterials such as wave guiding along curved trajectories.},

These methods use a non-deterministic approach that finds good solutions, despite not ensuring the determination of the overall optimum. The success of a metaheuristic is conditioned on its capacity of alternating properly between the exploration and exploitation of solution spaces. During the process of searching for better solutions, a metaheuristic can be guided to regions of promising solutions using the acquisition of information on the problem under study. In this study this is done through the use of reinforcement learning. The performance of a metaheuristic can also be improved using multiple search trajectories, which act competitively and/or cooperatively. This can be accomplished using parallel processing. Thus, in this paper we propose a hybrid parallel implementation for the GRASP metaheuristics and the genetic al gorithm, using reinforcement learning, applied to the symmetric traveling salesman problem.},

  abstract = {This paper extends to composite plates including piezoelectric plies the variable kinematics plate modeling approach called Sublaminate Generalized Unified Formulation (SGUF). Two-dimensional plate equations are obtained upon defining a priori the through-thickness distribution of the displacement field and electric potential. According to SGUF, independent approximations can be adopted for the four components of these generalized displacements: an Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) or Layer-Wise (LW) description over an arbitrary group of plies constituting the composite plate (the sublaminate) and the polynomial order employed in each sublaminate. The solution of the two-dimensional equations is sought in weak form by means of a Ritz method. In this work, boundary functions are used in conjunction with the domain approximation expressed by an orthogonal basis spanned by Legendre polynomials. The proposed computational tool is capable to represent electroded surfaces with equipotentiality conditions. Free-vibration problems as well as static problems involving actuator and sensor configurations are addressed. Two case studies are presented, which demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed Ritz-SGUF approach. A model assessment is proposed for showcasing to which extent the SGUF approach allows a reduction of the number of unknowns with a controlled impact on the accuracy of the result.},

The approach is denoted here as Trigonometric Ritz method (TRM). Since its introduction, application of TRM was limited to a very few plate problems. The aim of this work is to extend the potential of the method on predicting natural flexural frequencies of plates with various complicating factors, including in-plane loads, elastically restrained edges, rigid/elastic concentrated masses, intermediate line and point supports or their combinations. Computational efficiency, stability, convergence and accuracy of the method are discussed and supported by extensive analysis. TRM-based solutions are compared with many reference cases available in the literature obtained with other methods or Ritz functions. Numerical results indicate that TRM exhibits good to excellent accuracy for all cases considered. New solutions are also presented for future comparison purpose.},

We present the continuous equations that Simudo solves, show the FEM formulations we have developed, and demonstrate how they allow robust convergence with double-precision floating point arithmetic. With a benchmark semiconductor pn junction device, we show that Simudo has a higher rate of convergence than Synopsys Sentaurus, converging to high accuracy with a considerably smaller mesh. Simudo includes many semiconductor phenomena and parameters and is designed for extensibility by the user to include many physical processes.},

The non-uniqueness of the excitation coeffcient is due to a choice of the linearization of Maxwell's equation with respect to \$\textbackslash omega\$ and of the form of the source term.

The position determination is usually done by fitting a 2-D Gaussian (x-y vs. photon number) to the emission intensity distribution of the fluorescent molecule. However, the intensity distribution of an emitting molecule depends not only on its position in space, but also on its three-dimensional orientation. Here, we present an extensive numerical study of the achievable accuracy of position determination as a function of molecule orientation. We compare objectives with different numerical apertures and show that an effective pixel size of 100 nm or less per CCD pixel is required to obtain good positional accuracy. Nonetheless, orientation effects can still cause position errors for large anisotropy, as high as 10 nm for high numerical aperture objectives. However, position accuracy is significantly better (\&lt; 2.5 nm) when using objectives with a numerical aperture of 1.2. Of course, probes with lower anisotropy decrease the positional uncertainty.},

Jerk is the change in acceleration over time. In this method, the classical finite element of the beam is modified by the inclusion of the inertial effects of the moving mass. This modification is made using the relations between nodal forces and nodal deflections and shape functions of six DOF beam element. The mass, stiffness, and damping matrices of the modified finite element are determined by forces caused by the corresponding transverse and lateral accelerations and jerks, and transverse Coriolis and centripetal accelerations and jerks, respectively. This method was first applied on a simply supported beam plate to provide a comparison with the previous studies in literature, and it was proved that the results were within acceptable limits. Secondly, it was applied on a CNC type box-framed beam to analyse the dynamic response of the beam in terms of variable acceleration and jerk as well as constant velocity and mass ratios.},

  abstract = {Recent studies on artificial materials and metamaterials demonstrate that substantial improvements in electromagnetic response can be attained by combining different materials subject to desired metrics. However, the perfect material combination is unique and extremely difficult to determine without formal synthesis schemes. Existing ``conventional'' metamaterials are based on analytical or experimental studies, i.e. a formal design approach to predict the exact spatial combination of material constituents from scratch does not exist. In this paper, we develop a versatile approach to design the microstructure of 3D materials with prescribed dielectric and magnetic material tensors. The proposed framework is based on a robust material model and generalized inverse synthesis tool relying on topology optimization. The former is derived using homogenization theory and asymptotic expansion applied to Maxwell equations and can characterize the effects of anisotropy and loss of materials with periodic unit cells of arbitrary geometries and multi-phases much smaller than the wavelength. Towards that goal, earlier developed synthesis framework [Y. El-Kahlout and G. Kiziltas, PIER, 115, 343-380, 2011] that is capable of realizing predefined material constitutive parameters via designing the microstructure of artificial electromagnetic substrates will be updated to incorporate spectral dispersion and three dimensionality. The goal is to develop a formal design framework suitable for realizing the `unconventional' microstructure of 3D metamaterials that are inherently spectrally dispersive. The current design framework is suitable for designing the periodic microstructure of desired anisotropic artificial magneto-dielectrics from available isotropic material phases by integrating Finite Elements (FE) based analysis tool (using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS-PDE Coefficient Module) with optimization tools. Homogenizing Maxwell's Equations (MEQ) in order to estimate the effective spectral material parameters of the composite made of a periodic microstructure is the initial task of the framework. The FE analysis tool is used to evaluate intermediate fields at the `micro-scale' level of the periodic unit cell that is integrated with the homogenized MEQ's in order to calculate the `macro-scale' effective constitutive parameters of the overall bulk periodic structure that is spectral in nature. Consequently, the proposed framework based on the solution of homogenized MEQ's via the micro-macro approach allows topology design capabilities of microstructures with desired frequency dependent material properties in three dimensions. This capability is demonstrated on a comparison with known spectral behaviors of metamaterials in literature including hyperbolic media. Then, the developed material model is employed to solve a two step inverse design problem. First, metamaterials with desired novel reflection/transmission response will be designed to determine their `effective' spectral material properties via optimization schemes. Next step will be to synthesize the microstructure of the effective material property obtained earlier. Initial design results show that the creation of a new class of 3D artificial material to custom design is indeed possible pointing towards the possibility to synthesize alternative metamaterial microstructures with low loss from `scratch' overcoming the loss issue known of existing metamaterials. If successful when combined with advanced manufacturing schemes such as self-assembly, direct printing and novel sintering schemes, these capabilities will allow the automatic generation of totally novel yet unthinkable material designs that will lead to a new paradigm in electromagnetic material design.},

Mohammadi Estakhri et al. demonstrate that specially designed nanophotonic structures can take input waveforms encoded as complex mathematical functions, manipulate them, and provide an output that is the integral of the functions. The results, demonstrated for microwaves, provide a route to develop chip-based analog optical computers and computing elements. Science, this issue p. 1333 Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving integral equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed integral operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic integral equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.

Gradient or locally nonperiodic metasurfaces are one of the most exciting recent advances in nano-optics, due to the promise of enabling ultimate light molding, in both the near-field and the far-field, with large efficiency and a minimal footprint. These artificial surfaces are characterized by a transverse variation of their surface properties and lack of local periodicity, distinguishing them from conventional frequency selective surfaces and optical gratings. In this paper, we review recent work in the area of gradient metasurfaces, aimed at arbitrary wave shaping. The significant recent progress and novel applications achieved through optical metasurfaces, including ultrathin invisibility cloaks and polarization-dependent light splitting, are discussed, outlining the typical challenges and their outstanding prospects in integrated nanophotonic devices. Following our discussion on metasurface design approaches, we then revisit the problem of controlling the distribution of energy between multiple diffraction orders by means of gradient metasurfaces. Our discussions reveal that Huygens-based designs hold the promise of overcoming the low conversion efficiency issues associated with other techniques.},

In a second step we focus on the phase diagram of a prototypical ferroelectric as described by the temperature-dependent Landau-Devonshire model including thermal fluctuations. Our simulations show the emergence of phase instability at reduced sizes which we attribute to thermal fluctuations in the order parameter in the respective phase. We conclude that, along with the temperature-dependent potential coefficients, thermal fluctuations should be taken into account to achieve a comprehensive description of the thermal behavior of reduced-size ferroelectrics. To support our conclusions, we simulated the electric-field activated switching time for a multidomain system and compared the results to the predictions of well-established models such as Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi.},

In this paper, we show the concurrent emergence of truncated convolution errors could entirely disrupt the performance of most reconstruction techniques in the vicinity of discontinuities. They arise when the Fourier coefficients of the product of two discontinuous functions, namely \$f=gh\$, are approximated via truncated convolution of the corresponding Fourier series, i.e. \$\textbackslash hat\{f\}\_k\textbackslash approx \textbackslash sum\_\{|\textbackslash ell|\textbackslash leqslant N\}\{\textbackslash hat\{g\}\_\textbackslash ell\textbackslash hat\{h\}\_\{k-\textbackslash ell\}\}\$. Nonetheless, we numerically illustrate and rigorously prove that the classical Gegenbauer method remains exceptionally robust against this phenomenon, with the reconstruction error still diminishing proportional to \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\^\{-1\})\$ for the Fourier order \$N\$, and exponentially fast regardless of a constant. Finally, as a case study and a problem of interest in grating analysis whence the phenomenon initially was noticed, we demonstrate the emergence and practical resolution of truncated convolution errors in grating modes, which constitute the basis of Fourier modal methods.},

Analysis of structures from simple molecules like N-methylacetamide, to polyamides, peptides and relatively complex proteins provides different types of information dependant on the molecular size. The absorbance spectrum of small molecules is dominated by individual modes and specific hydrogen bonds, peptide spectra have peaks associated with secondary structure, while protein spectra are dominated by ensembles of hydrogen bonds and/or collective modes. Protein dynamics has been studied using Terahertz spectroscopy using proteins like bacteriorhodopsin, illustrating a potential application where this approach can provide complementary global dynamics information to the current nuclear magnetic resonance and fluorescence-based techniques. Analysis of higher-order protein structures like polyomavirus virus-like particles generate quite different spectra compared to their constituent parts. The presence of an extended hydration layer around proteins, first postulated to explain data generated using p-germanium spectroscopy may present a particularly interesting opportunity to better understand protein's complex interaction with water and small solutes in an aqueous environment. The practical aspects of Terahertz spectroscopy including sample handling, the use of molecular dynamics simulation and orthogonal experiment design are also discussed.},

The method is widely applied to characterize bulk material and liquids and has recently been extended to thin sheet material samples. However, it is commonly believed that the method is not suitable in the high-frequency regime as perfect contact between the probe and the sample is required. Furthermore, the method is limited with respect to the characterization of thin sheet samples made of low-loss materials. In this paper, we analyzed the main causes of these limitations, namely, low-sensitivity, probe resonances, and the occurrence of air-gaps between probe and samples. We also discuss and demonstrate solutions to overcome some of these limitations and improve the accuracy by introducing a lossy platform and an effective air-gap calibration algorithm. These improvements lead to a reliable and robust framework to characterize thin and flat dielectric samples, even at high frequencies and in high permittivity regimes.},

For decades, there has been tremendous effort to fashion focal plane arrays for THz imaging owing to the great number of potential applications. Here, we propose and demonstrate an alternative approach which utilizes all-dielectric metasurface absorbers that act as universal converters of radiation. Incident THz waves are absorbed by the metasurface, converted to heat, and subsequently detected by an infrared camera. We realize a metasurface consisting of sub-wavelength cylindrical resonators that achieve diffraction-limited imaging at THz frequencies without cooling. The low thermal conductivity and diffusivity significantly limit the thermal conduction between neighboring pixels, thus improving the spatial resolution and imaging time. Similar to conventional metallic-based metamaterials, our all-dielectric metasurface absorber can be scaled to other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, offering a blueprint to achieve novel uncooled bolometric imaging.},

We demonstrate an increase of up to 10 orders of magnitude in the carrier density in the SRR gaps on semi-insulating GaAs.

  abstract = {The properties of ferroelectric devices are strongly influenced, besides crystallographic features, by defects in the material. To study this effect, a fully coupled electromechanical phase-field model for 2D ferroelectric volume elements has been developed and implemented in a Finite Element code. Different kinds of defects were considered: holes, point charges and polarization pinning in single crystals, as well as grain boundaries in polycrystals, without and with additional dielectric interphase. The impact of the various types of defects on the domain configuration and the overall coercive field strength is discussed in detail. It can be seen that defects lead to nucleation of new domains. Compared to the energy barrier for switching in an ideal single crystal, the overall coercive field strength is significantly reduced towards realistic values as they are found in ferroelectric devices. Also the simulated hysteresis loops show a more realistic shape in the presence of defects.},

In this sense, we strike out in a new direction in mechanics computations with strongly predictive NNs whose success depends not only on architectures being deep, but also being fundamentally different from the widely-used to date. We consider a model problem: predicting the eigenvalues of 1-D and 2-D phononic crystals. For the 1-D case, the optimal CNN architecture reaches 98\% accuracy level on unseen data when trained with just 20,000 samples, compared to 85\% accuracy even with 100, 000 samples for the typical network of choice in mechanics research. We show that, with relatively high data-efficiency, CNNs have the capability to generalize well and automatically learn deep symmetry operations, easily extending to higher dimensions and our 2D case. Most importantly, we show how CNNs can naturally represent mechanical material tensors, with its convolution kernels serving as local receptive fields, which is a natural representation of mechanical response. Strategies proposed are applicable to other mechanics' problems and may, in the future, be used to sidestep cumbersome algorithms with purely data-driven approaches based upon modern deep architectures.},

To achieve a desired effect one is typically interested in smoothly varying fields that satisfy a sparse set of user-provided constraints. Using tools from Discrete Exterior Calculus, we present a simple and efficient algorithm for designing such fields over arbitrary triangle meshes. By representing the field as scalars over mesh edges (i.e., discrete 1-forms), we obtain an intrinsic, coordinate-free formulation in which field smoothness is enforced through discrete Laplace operators. Unlike previous methods, such a formulation leads to a linear system whose sparsity permits efficient pre-factorization. Constraints are incorporated through weighted least squares and can be updated rapidly enough to enable interactive design, as we demonstrate in the context of anisotropic texture synthesis.},

The introduction of the surrogates into the evolutionary cycle is controlled by a single parameter, which is related with the number of generations performed by the evolutionary algorithm.Numerical experiments are conducted in order to assess the applicability and the performance in constrained and unconstrained, single- and multi-objective optimization problems. The results show that the present framework arises as an attractive alternative to improve the final solutions with a fixed budget of expensive evaluations.},

Descriptions for plasmon excitation in Fano resonant lattices in non-vacuum environments typically use idealized, homogeneous matrices due to computational expense and limitations of common approaches. This work described both localized and coupled resonance activity of two-dimensional, square lattices of gold (Au) nanospheres (NS) in discontinuous, complex dielectric media using compact synthesis of discrete and coupled dipole approximations. This multi-scale approach supported attribution of experimentally observed spectral resonance energy and bandwidth to interactions between metal and dielectric substrate(s) supporting the lattices. Effective polarizabilities of single AuNS, either in vacuo or supported by glass and/or indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, were obtained with discrete dipole approximation (DDA). This showed plasmon energy transport varied with type of substrate: glass increased scattering, while ITO increased absorption and energy confinement. Far-field lattice interactions between AuNS with/without substrates were computed by coupled dipole approximation (CDA) using effective polarizabilities. This showed glass enhanced diffractive features (e.g., coupled lattice resonance), while ITO supported plasmon modes. This compact, multiscale approach to describe metasurfaces in complex environments could accelerate their development and application.},

Periodic three-dimensional (3D) polymer micro/nanostructures are fabricated by means of a microlens array to produce multiple spots from a single-beam femtosecond laser amplified by a regenerative amplifier. The photopolymerizable resin and the glass substrate are chemically modified, and a pre-treatment with SnCl2 is applied before realizing a uniform silver coating by electroless plating. This preparation enables a selective deposition of small silver particles only on the polymer surface all over the sample and to avoid metal deposition on the substrate. Electrical measurements show the structures to be highly conductive with typical resistivities \&\#961; approx. 10\textsuperscript{-7} \&\#937;m, only a few times larger than the value for bulk silver. By taking advantage of the high accuracy and arbitrary shape modeling of TPP fabrication, we can realize complex periodic and/or metallic micro-nanostructures which were so far out of reach. Thus, a straightforward application could be the realization of metamaterials. The processing efficiency of our technique is demonstrated with the fabrication of several large samples, created by more than 700 objects written in parallel and metallized with silver.}

A flat-top transmission spectrum with a steep phase profile, which turns out to be essential to realize a highly-efficient spatial light modulator in transmission mode, is formed by excitation of two spectrally close Fabry-P\'erot-type and guided-mode resonances. The refractive-index of Si nanobars is electrically modulated by the injection of electrons and holes using a P\textendash I\textendash N junction configuration, considered along each nanobar. It is theoretically demonstrated that wide phase agility of 215\textdegree{} and transmission amplitude higher than 0.6 (with an average of {$\approx$}0.83) can be accomplished at the operating wavelength of {$\approx$}1.55 \textmu m. This wide-range tunability is realized by introducing free electron and hole carrier densities of {$\increment$}N = {$\increment$}P = 5 \texttimes{} 1018 cm-3 accompanied with Si refractive-index-change of {$\increment$}nSi = 0.01. The transmission phase of each unit cell can be separately controlled, which in turn allows to design a tunable meta-array with real-time beam control.

  abstract = {Disordered dielectric materials with structural correlations show unconventional optical behavior: They can be transparent to long-wavelength radiation, while at the same time have isotropic band gaps in another frequency range. This phenomenon raises fundamental questions concerning photon transport through disordered media. While optical transparency in these materials is robust against recurrent multiple scattering, little is known about other transport regimes like diffusive multiple scattering or Anderson localization. Here, we investigate band gaps, and we report Anderson localization in 2D disordered dielectric structures using numerical simulations of the density of states and optical transport statistics. The disordered structures are designed with different levels of positional correlation encoded by the degree of stealthiness {$\chi\chi<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mi{$>\chi<$}/mml:mi{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}.

Designed optimal configurations provide superior performances in thermal cloaks for the steady-state thermal conduction and succeed in realizing thermal invisibility, despite the structures being simply composed of iron and aluminum and without inhomogeneities caused by employing metamaterials. To design thermal cloaks, a prescribed objective function is used to evaluate the difference between the temperature field controlled by a thermal cloak and when no thermal insulator is present. The CMA-ES involves searches for optimal sets of level-set functions as design variables that minimize a regularized fitness involving a perimeter constraint. Through topology optimization subject to structural symmetries about four axes, we obtain a concept design of a thermal cloak that functions in an isotropic heat flux.},

We illustrate the utility of these methods by using ensemble averaging to determine the microstructural parameters of anisotropic level-cut Gaussian fields. We find that the depolarization factor of these structures is equivalent to that of an isolated ellipse with the same stretching ratio, and we discuss the contribution of the fourth-order term to the exact anisotropy.},

Its origins lie in Hilbert's ``direct'' approach to the variational calculus of Euler--Lagrange and in the thesis of Walther Ritz, who died 100 years ago at the age of 31 after a long battle with tuberculosis. The thesis was submitted in 1902 in G\"ottingen, during a period of dramatic developments in physics. Ritz tried to explain the phenomenon of Balmer series in spectroscopy using eigenvalue problems of partial differential equations on rectangular domains. While this physical model quickly turned out to be completely obsolete, his mathematics later enabled him to solve difficult problems in applied sciences. He thereby revolutionized the variational calculus and became one of the fathers of modern computational mathematics. We will see in this article that the path leading to modern computational methods and theory involved a long struggle over three centuries requiring the efforts of many great mathematicians.},

These easily programmed and readily implemented procedures robustly locate extrema of highly multimodal functions and therefore are particularly well suited to finding solutions to a broad range of electromagnetic optimization problems. Electromagnetic Optimization by Genetic Algorithms is the first book devoted exclusively to the application of genetic algorithms to electromagnetic device design. Compiled by two highly competent and well-respected members of the electromagnetics community, this book describes numerous applications of genetic algorithms to the design and optimization of various low- and high-frequency electromagnetic components.

However, water absorption in THz regime is an obstacle to extend application in trace biomolecules of cancer antibody or antigen. Here, to overcome water absorption and enhance the THz biosensing sensitivity, two kinds of THz metamaterials biosensor integrated with microfluidics were fabricated and used to detect the Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and Glutamine transferase isozymes II (GGT-II) of liver cancer biomarker in early stage. There were about 19\,GHz resonance shift (5 mu/ml) and 14.2\,GHz resonance shift (0.02524\,{$\mu$}g/ml) for GGT-II and AFP with a two-gap-metamaterial, respectively, which agreed with simulation results. Those results demonstrated the power and usefulness of metamaterial-assisted THz spectroscopy in trace cancer biomarker molecular detection for biological and chemical sensing. Moreover, for a particular cancer biomarker, the sensitivity could be further improved by optimizing the metamaterial structure and decreasing the permittivity of the substrate. This method might be powerful and potential for special recognition of cancer molecules in the early stage.},

The analysis shows that in spite of the recent year's extensive efforts, no considerable improvement in the microwave losses in thin paraelectric films has been achieved. Thin films, regardless of fabrication method and substrate type, have much lower dielectric permittivity than bulk single crystals, and the loss tangent at microwave frequencies (f{$>$}10 GHz) is of the order of 0.01 (at zero dc-bias field) at room temperature. Nevertheless, quite promising component and subsystem level devices are successfully demonstrated. Use of ceramic (bulk and thick film) ferroelectrics in tunable microwave devices, currently considered for industrial applications, offer cost reduction. In this paper, explicitly for the first time, we consider possibilities and benefits of using ferroelectrics in polar phase in electrically controllable microwave devices. Examples of using ferroelectrics in polar state (e.g., Na/sub 0.5/K/sub 0.5/NbO/sub 3/, SrTiO/sub 3/ in antiferroelectric phase) in electrically tunable devices are reported.},

Existing methods developed by other researchers or the authors' group are overviewed and a new enhancement based on fitness inheritance is proposed. Whereas conventional evolutionary algorithms require a great number of calls to the evaluation software, the use of low cost surrogates or metamodels, trained on the fly on previously evaluated individuals for pre-evaluating the evolving populations, reduce noticeably the CPU cost of an optimization. Since, themetamodel training requires a minimum amount of previous evaluations, the starting population is evaluated on the problem-specific model. Fitness inheritance is introduced in this context so as to approximate the objective function values in place of metamodels. In addition, to profit of the availability of evaluation or parameterization models of lower fidelity and CPU cost and/or refinement methods, a multilevel search algorithm relying also on the use of metamodels is presented. The algorithm may optionally operate as hierarchical-distributed (many levels performing distributed optimization) or distributed-hierarchical (more than one sub-populations undergoing their own hierarchical optimizations) to further reduce the design cycle time. The proposed algorithms are generic and can be used to solve any kind of optimization problems. Here, aerodynamic shape optimization problems, including turbomachinery applications, are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. A new computationally demanding application, namely the optimization of a 3D compressor blade is also shown.},

For example, mobile ad hoc networks need directive antennas that are able to radiate in any direction across the 360\textdegree{} azimuth plane. Conformal antennas that can be simply operated to have multifunctional performance characteristics are therefore of interest. In this communication, we present a gradient-index lens antenna designed to radiate with a 45\textdegree{} beamwidth across eight different sectors. When fed by a simple switched feeding network, the lens is able to provide 360\textdegree{} azimuth coverage in 45\textdegree{} segments. Further analysis of the radiation patterns shows how two distinct multibeam patterns can be produced from simple feed networks and simultaneous excitation of each feeding element. The proposed lens is fabricated by multimaterial 3-D printing. The final lens radiates with a gain of 8.5 dBi when a single sector is excited, and with a maximum gain of 5.9 dBi in multibeam mode. Finally, it is shown how the lens can also radiate omnidirectionally when optimized phase and amplitude weightings are applied to each port.},

Modeling and simulation is the essential bridge from good science to good engineering, spanning from fundamental understanding of materials behavior to deliberate design of new materials technologies leveraging new properties and processes. This Roadmap presents a broad overview of the extensive impact computational modeling has had in materials science in the past few decades, and offers focused perspectives on where the path forward lies as this rapidly expanding field evolves to meet the challenges of the next few decades. The Roadmap offers perspectives on advances within disciplines as diverse as phase field methods to model mesoscale behavior and molecular dynamics methods to deduce the fundamental atomic-scale dynamical processes governing materials response, to the challenges involved in the interdisciplinary research that tackles complex materials problems where the governing phenomena span different scales of materials behavior requiring multiscale approaches. The shift from understanding fundamental materials behavior to development of quantitative approaches to explain and predict experimental observations requires advances in the methods and practice in simulations for reproducibility and reliability, and interacting with a computational ecosystem that integrates new theory development, innovative applications, and an increasingly integrated software and computational infrastructure that takes advantage of the increasingly powerful computational methods and computing hardware.},

Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement (\textbackslash (q-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I\textbackslash )), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the \textbackslash (q-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I\textbackslash ) is given when q = 2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the \textbackslash (q-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I\textbackslash ), and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q {$\in$} [1,10]).},

We treat the most general case of N parallel cylinders placed in arbitrary positions. The exact theory is obtained by developing the polarisation charge surface density on each cylinder in a Fourier series. The related coefficients, the so-called multipoles, may be obtained from a linear set of equations which is derived and analysed in the paper. For systems of closely spaced cylinders, with high ratio of the dielectric constant of the cylinders compared to that of the homogeneous medium (in the worst case, conductive cylinders in contact with each other) a very large number of multipole terms is required to achieve convergence. In spite of the large number of required terms, the general multipole expansion is rapidly convergent in all other cases and is important from a theoretical point of view. Numerical results are presented for canonical dispositions of cylinders and for more complicated arrangements. Finally, such a multipole expansion has been applied to the dielectric characterisation of composite materials formed by a regular array of parallel cylinders, thereby obtaining the equivalent permittivity using a numerically efficient technique.},

Here we show that the nonlocal response of a compact scatterer can be engineered to impart operations of choice on arbitrary impinging waves, and even to solve integro-differential equations, whose solution is observed in the scattered fields. The lack of strongly resonant phenomena makes the response robust, and the compact nature opens to scalability and cascading of these processes, paving the way to efficient, compact analog computers based on engineered microstructures.},

Here, we show how designer superconductor materials integrated into PCs fabrication allow for an extraordinary reduction of electromagnetic waves damping, making possible their optimal propagation and tuning through the structure, below critical superconductor temperature. We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a successful integration of ferroelectric and superconductor materials into a one-dimensional (1D) PC composed of \$\$(\{\textbackslash text \{B\}\}\{\textbackslash text \{T\}\}\{\textbackslash text \{O\}\}/\{\textbackslash text \{Y\}\}\{\textbackslash text \{B\}\}\{\textbackslash text \{C\}\} \{\textbackslash text \{O\}\})\_\{\{\textbackslash text \{N\}\}\}/\{\textbackslash text \{S\}\}\{\textbackslash text \{T\}\}\{\textbackslash text \{O\}\}\$\$(BTO/YBCO)N/STO bilayers that work in the whole visible spectrum, and below (and above) critical superconductor temperature \$\$T\_C=80\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash hbox \{K\}\}\$\$TC=80K.

  abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a continuously growing additive manufacturing technology that aside from physical prototypes can also deliver functional prototypes and devices for radiofrequency (RF) and microwave applications. The very recent introduction of high-permittivity filaments for FFF has been one of the main facilitators for this major advancement, aiding microwave engineers to realise academics concepts that have thus far been impossible to fabricate and therefore invent new designs. However, the value to the RF community of these devices depends on accurate knowledge and repeatability of the electromagnetic properties of the materials being used which strongly relies on the processing strategy used during printing. This paper investigates the use of a high-permittivity filament and studies the impact of layer height and infill density on the relative permittivity ({$\epsilon$}r) and loss tangent (tan{$\delta$}). A maximum relative permittivity of {$\epsilon$}r~=~9.63~{$\pm~$}0.16 and tan{$\delta~$}=~0.003~{$\pm~$}0.0003 was achieved with a 200~{$\mu$}m layer thickness and 100\% infill density. Finally, the results of this study are used in designing, simulating, 3D printing and measuring the performance of a novel graded-index dielectric lens operating at 10~GHz.},

However, due to their nature and synthesis, they are often a great challenge to print successfully which in turn affects their microwave properties. Hence, determining the optimum printing strategy and settings is important to advance this area. The manufacturing study presented in this paper shows the impact of the main process parameters: printing speed, hatch spacing, layer height and material infill, during 3D printing on the relative permittivity ({$\epsilon$}r), and loss tangent (tan{$\delta$}) of the resultant additively manufactured test samples.

Piezoelectric transducers can be integrated into such composite structures for a variety of vibration control and energy harvesting applications. Analyzing the structural dynamics of such electromechanical systems requires precise modeling tools which properly consider the coupling between the piezoelectric elements and the laminates. Although previous analytical models in the literature cover vibration analysis of laminated composite plates with fully covered piezoelectric layers, they do not provide a formulation for modeling the piezoelectric patches that partially cover the plate surface. In this study, a methodology for vibration analysis of laminated composite plates with surface-bonded piezo-patches is developed. Rayleigh?Ritz method is used for solving the modal analysis and obtaining the frequency response functions. The developed model includes mass and stiffness contribution of the piezo-patches as well as the two-way electromechanical coupling effect. Moreover, an accelerated method is developed for reducing the computation time of the modal analysis solution. For validations, system-level finite element simulations are performed in ANSYS software. The results show that the developed analytical model can be utilized for accurate and efficient analysis and design of laminated composite plates with surface-bonded piezo-patches.},

This strategy to obtain meso-organized multi-metal-oxide nanocrystalline films (M(3)NF) bridges the gap between conventional mesoporous materials and the remarkable properties of crystalline ternary or quaternary metallic oxides. Nanocrystalline mesoporous films with controlled wall thickness (10-20 nm) of dielectric SrTiO(3), photoactive MgTa(2)O(6) or ferromagnetic semi-conducting Co(x)Ti(1-x)O(2-x) were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) using a specially designed non-ionic block-copolymer template. A tuned thermal treatment of the mesoporous films permits the transfer of the wall structure into nanocrystallites, with all tectonic units being tightly incorporated into mechanically stable ordered tri- or bidimensional nanocrystalline networks. This methodology should allow multifunctionalization, miniaturization and integration during development of devices such as smart sensors and actuators, better-performing photocatalysts, and fast electrochromic devices. On the other hand, organized arrays of dispersed ferromagnetic or ferroelectric nanoparticles are promising materials for spintronics and for cheap, non-volatile 'flash' memories.},

The homogenized medium is described by anisotropic matrices of permittivity and permeability, deduced from the resolution of two annex problems of electrostatic type on a periodic cell. Noteworthily, this asymptotic analysis also covers the case of photonic crystals with non-cuboidal periodic cells. We solve numerically the associated system of partial differential equations with a method of fictitious charges and a finite element method (FEM) in order to exhibit the matrices of effective permittivity and permeability for given magneto-dielectric periodic composites. We then compare our results in the 2D case against some Fourier expansion approach and provide duality relations in the case of magneto-dielectric checkerboards. We further compute some low-frequency eigenmodes of a photonic crystal fiber with metallic outer boundary and compare them with the eigenmodes of a corresponding effective anisotropic waveguide, thanks to the FEM. Finally, we derive the effective properties of a 3D photonic crystal both through classical homogenization (solving numerically two decoupled annex problems) and Bloch wave homogenization. In the case of spherical inclusions, the latter approach amounts to evaluating the slope of the first band around the origin on a Bloch diagram which we compute using finite edge elements.},

In this context, the objective of this review is to discuss recent advances in THz imaging with an emphasis on the modalities that could enable real-time high-resolution imaging. To this end, we first discuss several key imaging modalities developed over the years: THz transmission, reflection, and conductivity imaging; THz pulsed imaging; THz computed tomography; and THz near-field imaging. Then, we discuss several enabling technologies for real-time THz imaging within the time-domain spectroscopy paradigm: fast optical delay lines, photoconductive antenna arrays, and electro-optic sampling with cameras. Next, we discuss the advances in THz cameras, particularly THz thermal cameras and THz field-effect transistor cameras. Finally, we overview the most recent techniques that enable fast THz imaging with single-pixel detectors: mechanical beam-steering, compressive sensing, spectral encoding, and fast Fourier optics. We believe that this critical and comprehensive review of enabling hardware, instrumentation, algorithms, and potential applications in real-time high-resolution THz imaging can serve a diverse community of fundamental and applied scientists.},

However, one major problem with advanced registration techniques is their high computational cost. Due to this restraint, these methods have found limited application to clinical situations where real time or near real time execution is required, e.g., intraoperative imaging, or high volumes of data need to be processed periodically. High performance in image registration can be achieved by reduction in data and search spaces. However, to obtain a significant increase in performance, these approaches must be complemented with parallel processing. Parallel processing is associated with expensive supercomputers and computer clusters that are unaffordable for most public medical institutions. This chapter will describe how to take advantage of an existing computational infrastructure and achieve high performance image registration in a practical and affordable way. More specifically, it will outline the implementation of a fast and robust Internet subtraction service, using a distributed evolutionary algorithm and a service-oriented architecture.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the treatment of expensive optimization problems in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) problems by combining two strategies. First, we perform the whole optimization varying the accuracy with which a given candidate solution is evaluated by the expensive black-box function, rather than using the same accuracy for all evaluations. This idea follows from the fact that evolutionary algorithms, in general, employ more searching effort on the most promising regions of the search domain.We can adopt the same principles for allocating more computational effort when evaluating candidate solutions within these regions. The second strategy is the employment of local approximations within the local search operator of memetic algorithms. Since the points in the data are evaluated with different accuracies, the approximation methodology should give greater weight to samples evaluated with higher precision. The chapter proceeds to the formal analysis of approximation-based memetic algorithms, in which we investigate the effect of the local search operators on the global convergence properties of evolutionary algorithms viaMarkov chain theory, and also study the computational complexity of the approximation-based local search operator. The chapter concludeswith the illustration of the methodology in the design of electromagnetic devices, as an example of an expensive optimization problem.},

This emerging field of superconducting quantum microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in microwave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the interaction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting quantum information processing. In this article, we review experimental and theoretical progress in microwave photonics with superconducting quantum circuits. We hope that this global review can provide a useful roadmap for this rapidly developing field.},

In this work, it is demonstrated how these mechanical properties can be complemented by dynamic functionalities resulting from robust topological guiding of elastic waves at interfaces that are incorporated into the considered material platforms. Starting from the definition of Schwarz P minimal surface, geometric parametrizations are introduced that break spatial symmetry by forming 1D dimerized and 2D hexagonal minimal surface-based materials. Breaking of spatial symmetries produces topologically non-trivial interfaces that support the localization of vibrational modes and the robust propagation of elastic waves along pre-defined paths. These dynamic properties are predicted through numerical simulations and are illustrated by performing vibration and wave propagation experiments on additively manufactured samples. The introduction of symmetry-breaking topological interfaces through parametrizations that modify the geometry of periodic minimal surfaces suggests a new strategy to supplement the load-bearing properties of this class of materials with novel dynamic functionalities.},

In these applications, of particular importance is the Laplacian, the simplest isotropic derivative operator in two dimensions. Spatial differentiation can be implemented electronically. However, in applications requiring real-time and high-throughput image differentiation, conventional digital computations become challenging. Optical analog computing may overcome this challenge by offering high-throughput low-energy-consumption operations using compact devices. However, previous works on spatial differentiation with nanophotonic structures are restricted to either one-dimensional differentiation or reflection mode, whereas operating in the transmission mode is important because it is directly compatible with standard image processing/recognition systems. Here, we show that the Laplacian can be implemented in the transmission mode by a photonic crystal slab device. We theoretically derive the criteria for realizing the Laplacian using the guided resonances in a photonic crystal slab. Guided by these criteria, we show that the Laplacian can be implemented using a carefully designed photonic crystal slab with a non-trivial isotropic band structure near the \&\#x0393; point. Our work points to new opportunities in optical analog computing as provided by nanophotonic structures.},

  abstract = {Nanowires are one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures with comparatively large aspect ratios, which can be useful in manipulating electrons, photons, plasmons, phonons, and atoms for numerous technologies. Among various nanostructures for low-dimensional photonics, the 1D nanowire is of great importance owing to its ability to route tightly confined light fields in single-mode with lowest space and material requirements, minimized optical path, and high mechanical flexibilities. In recent years, nanowire photonics have increasingly been attracting scientists' interests for both fundamental studies and technological applications because 1D nanowires have more favorable properties than many other structures, such as 0D quantum dots (QDs) and 2D films.As subwavelength waveguides, free-standing nanowires fabricated by either chemical growth or physical drawing techniques surpass nanowaveguides fabricated by almost all other means in terms of sidewall smoothness and diameter uniformity. This conveys their low waveguiding losses. With high index contrast (typically higher than 0.5) between the core and the surrounding or with surface plasmon resonance, a nanowire can guide light with tight optical confinement. For example, the effective mode area is less than {$\lambda$}2/10 for a dielectric nanowire or less than {$\lambda$}2/100 for a metal nanowire, where {$\lambda$} is the vacuum wavelength of the light. As we increase the wavelength-to-diameter ratio (WDR) of a nanowire, we can enlarge the fractional power of the evanescent fields in the guiding modes to over 80\% while maintaining a small effective mode area, which may enable highly localized near-field interaction between the guided fields and the surrounding media. These favorable properties have opened great opportunities for optical sensing on the single-nanowire scale. However, several questions arise with ongoing research. With a deep-subwavelength cross-section, how can we efficiently couple light into a single nanowire? How can we fabricate a nanowire with low optical loss? How can we activate a passive nanowire for optical sensing? And lastly, how can we adapt mature optical measurement technology onto a nanowire?In this Account, we highlight our initial attempts to address the above-mentioned challenges. First, we introduce the fabrication and functionalization of low-loss photonic nanowires. We show that nanowires fabricated by either top-down physical drawing (e.g., for amorphous nanowires) or bottom-up chemical growth (e.g., for crystalline nanowires) can yield excellent geometric and structural uniformities with surface roughness down to atomic level and minimize the scattering loss for subwavelength optical or plasmonic waveguiding. Then, relying on a near-field fiber-probe micromanipulation, we demonstrate optical launching of single nanowires by evanescent coupling, with coupling efficiency up to 90\% for dielectric nanowires and 80\% for plasmonic nanowires. Third, we discuss the waveguiding properties of nanowires and emphasize their outstanding capability of waveguiding tightly confined optical fields with high fractional evanescent fields. In addition, we briefly show a balance between the loss, confinement, and bandwidth in a waveguiding nanowire. Fourthly, we present promising approaches to single-nanowire optical sensors. By measuring optical absorption or spectral transmission of a nanowire and activating nanowires with sensitive dopants, we demonstrate a single-nanowire optical sensor with high sensitivity, fast response, and low optical power. This may lead to a novel platform for optical sensing at nanoscale. Finally, we conclude with an outlook for future challenges in the light manipulation and sensing applications of photonic nanowires.},

We explain how to incorporate the momentum balance and constitutive relations into PINN, and explore in detail the application to linear elasticity, although the framework is rather general and can be extended to other solid-mechanics problems. While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network\textemdash thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

Opt. Soc. Am. A33, 1298 (2016)JOAOD61084-752910.1364/JOSAA.33.001298]. Here, we generalize the approach to three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates, allowing for the modeling of rectangular geometries in open space. The open boundary condition is a consequence of having an infinite computational domain described using basis functions that expand the whole space. The strength of the method lies in discretizing the Fourier integrals using a non-uniform circular \&\#x201C;dartboard\&\#x201D; sampling of the Fourier k space. We show that our sampling technique leads to a more accurate description of the continuum of the radiation modes that leak out from the structure. We also compare our approach to conventional discretization with direct and inverse factorization rules commonly used in established Fourier modal methods. We apply our method to a variety of optical waveguide structures and demonstrate that the method leads to a significantly improved convergence, enabling more accurate and efficient modeling of open 3D nanophotonic structures.},

These operators are based on Preisach and Jiles-Atherton hysteresis models which are well-established tools in ferromagnetic modeling. In contrast to micro-mechanical approaches, a Preisach or a Jiles-Atherton hysteresis operator can be efficiently numerically evaluated.

Use of non-standard integral equations, graded meshes, interpolatory quadrature, and compressed inverse preconditioning are techniques that are explored, developed, mixed, and tested on some familiar problems in materials science. The recursive compressed inverse preconditioning, the major novelty of the paper, turns out to be particularly powerful and, when it applies, eliminates the need for mesh grading completely. In an electrostatic example for a multiphase granular material with about two thousand corners and triple junctions and a conductivity ratio between phases up to a million we compute a common functional of the solution with an estimated relative error of 10-12. In another example, five times as large but with a conductivity ratio of only a hundred, we achieve an estimated relative error of 10-14.},

This, together with a reduction in the number of unknowns, allows for a substantial increase in achievable accuracy as well as in tractable system size. Results, accurate to at least nine digits, are obtained for random checkerboards with over a million squares in the unit cell at contrast ratio 106.

In this paper, we propose a multi-material topology optimization approach for the design of energy harvesting piezoelectric composite structures. The energy conversion efficiency of piezoelectric composite structure is maximized by optimally distributing elastic, piezoelectric and void materials. To this end, a multi-material interpolation model is particularly established. In order to improve gradient-based mathematical programming algorithms, analytical sensitivities of topological design variables are derived using the adjoint method. An additional constraint on structural compliance is considered in design to maintain the load-carrying capability and improve the convergence. A variety of numerical experiments are performed to test our approach on a benchmark composite beam with piezoelectric layers. The proposed approach has been shown effective in increasing the energy conversion efficiency by the simultaneous distribution of the piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric materials. The performance calibration of the optimized design and the reconstructed topologies based on computer-aided design demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under both static and harmonic load conditions.},

It has been developed on top of PETSc and enforces the same programming paradigm.The emphasis of the software is on methods and techniques appropriate for problems in which the associated matrices are sparse, for example, those arising after the discretization of partial differential equations. Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.},

Two optimized designs with uniform and nonuniform polarization profiles are obtained. Separated electrodes in the surfaces of the optimized design with non-uniform polarization are used to simulate the polarization profile. Numerical simulations by COMSOL multi-physics software show that the optimized design with separated electrodes can provide three times higher voltage and power than those obtained with non-optimized piezoelectric plate.

  abstract = {We introduce the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) for efficiently calculating the two-dimensional electric field distribution for our microwave tomographic breast imaging system. For iterative inverse problems such as microwave tomography, the forward field computation is the time limiting step. In this paper, the two-dimensional algorithm is derived and formulated such that the iterative conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient (COCG) method can be used for efficiently solving the forward problem. We have also optimized the matrix-vector multiplication step by formulating the problem such that the nondiagonal portion of the matrix used to compute the dipole moments is block-Toeplitz. The computation costs for multiplying the block matrices times a vector can be dramatically accelerated by expanding each Toeplitz matrix to a circulant matrix for which the convolution theorem is applied for fast computation utilizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The results demonstrate that this formulation is accurate and efficient. In this work, the computation times for the direct solvers, the iterative solver (COCG), and the iterative solver using the fast Fourier transform (COCG-FFT) are compared with the best performance achieved using the iterative solver (COCG-FFT) in C++. Utilizing this formulation provides a computationally efficient building block for developing a low cost and fast breast imaging system to serve under-resourced populations.},

Unfortunately, the quality of solutions depends heavily on how the problem is parameterized. In this paper, we propose using the implicit bias over functions induced by neural networks to improve the parameterization of structural optimization. Rather than directly optimizing densities on a grid, we instead optimize the parameters of a neural network which outputs those densities. This reparameterization leads to different and often better solutions. On a selection of 116 structural optimization tasks, our approach produces the best design 50\% more often than the best baseline method.},

However, most applications adopt crypsis-type camouflage that prevents the organisms from being detected by matching the environment, which is challenging to realize the large angle-of-view and broadband operation at optical frequencies. Here, as inspired by nature's system of masquerade, we demonstrate an optical masquerade, being detected but not recognized, with perturbative metasurfaces that could camouflage an object into another unrelated one under the oblique ({$\pm$}69\textdegree ) illumination of visible light with an {$\sim$}160 nm bandwidth. Predicted by the perturbation theory, the dielectric metastructures encircling a pistol-shaped object have a thin layer of nanodisk array, which can suppress the electromagnetic resonances of nanomodes for mimicking the transmitted intensity and phase of the camouflaged object. We also exhibit that optical masquerade is an invasive, environment-independent, object-unlimited, and material-extendable camouflage, which might benefit optical security, anticounterfeiting, and encoding.},

However, not all of the spectral structures of these eigenvalue problems are well-understood, and not all of these eigenvalue problems can be solved efficiently. This article focuses on the eigenvalue problems corresponding to wave vectors that are close to the center of the Brillouin zone of a three dimensional, simple cubic photonic crystal. For these eigenvalue problems, there are (i)~many zero eigenvalues, (ii)~a couple of near-zero eigenvalues, and (iii)~several larger eigenvalues. As the desired eigenvalues are the smallest positive eigenvalues, these particular spectral structures prevent regular eigenvalue solvers from efficiently computing the desired eigenvalues. We study these eigenvalue problems from the perspective of both theory and computation. On the theoretical side, the structures of the null spaces are analyzed to explicitly determine the number of zero eigenvalues of the target eigenvalue problems. On the computational side, the Krylov-Schur and Jacobi-Davidson methods are used to compute the smallest, positive, interior eigenvalues that are of interest. Intensive numerical experiments disclose how the shift values, conditioning numbers, and initial vectors affect the performance of the tested eigenvalue solvers and suggest the most efficient eigenvalue solvers.},

The effective permeability and effective permittivity of the composite are obtained by applying the homogenization technique to the representative periodic base cell (PBC). Single or multiple objectives are defined to maximize or minimize the electromagnetic properties separately or simultaneously. The sensitivity analysis of the objective function is conducted using the adjoint method. Based on the established sensitivity number, BESO gradually evolves the topology of the PBC to an optimum. Numerical examples demonstrate that the electromagnetic properties of the resulting 2D and 3D microstructures are very close to the theoretical Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds. The proposed BESO algorithm is computationally efficient as the solution usually converges in less than 50 iterations. The proposed BESO method can be implemented easily as a post-processor to standard commercial finite element analysis software packages, e.g. ANSYS which has been used in this study. The resulting topologies are clear black-and-white solutions (with no grey areas). Some interesting topological patterns such as Vigdergauz-type structure and Schwarz primitive structure have been found which will be useful for the design of electromagnetic materials.},

Additionally, periodic boundary and normalization constraint conditions are proposed to determine the unique solution to unit cell problems. Moreover, standard finite element formulations for calculating the perturbed displacements are derived from the principle of virtual work.

Wave physics, as found in acoustics and optics, is a natural candidate for building analog processors for time-varying signals. Here we identify a mapping between the dynamics of wave physics, and the computation in recurrent neural networks. This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inverse-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio signals as their waveforms scatter and propagate through it, achieving performance comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain.},

  abstract = {This article presents a modelling methodology for a cantilevered energy harvester with partial piezoelectric coverage and shunted to practical power conditioning interface circuits. First, the distributed parameter model of the partially covered piezoelectric energy harvester is developed and the associated analytical solution is derived. Subsequently, the single-degree-of-freedom representation model is developed and the explicit expressions of equivalent lumped parameters are derived by taking the static deflection as the approximated fundamental vibration mode. Based on the comparison with the single-mode expression of the distributed parameter model, a correction factor is proposed to improve the accuracy of the single-degree-of-freedom model. The results of both the distributed parameter and the corrected single-degree-of-freedom models are compared. The accuracy of the corrected single-degree-of-freedom representation model is verified against the analytical and the finite element models. Finally, practical interface circuits including the standard energy harvesting circuit and the parallel synchronized switch harvesting on inductor circuit are considered. A modified equivalent impedance modelling method is proposed for the analysis of the standard energy harvesting and parallel synchronized switch harvesting on inductor circuits. The results of the modified equivalent impedance modelling method are verified against the existing method in the literature.},

However, the main thrust toward the development of ultrafast switchable components and optical logic operations is still in a catch-up stage for progressively increasing information and communication demands. Here, a novel spatiotemporal metadevice is proposed for terahertz wave steering in multidimensional domains with ultrahigh spatial and ultrafast temporal manipulations. By spatially changing the interconnect architecture via the embedded vanadium dioxide bridges, the state of electromagnetically induced transparency resonance is switched between ``1'' and ``0'' states under electrical stimuli, exhibiting a typical 1 bit coding bistability with a long retention time. Furthermore, with the characteristic of writable/erasable logic operation, ultrafast photoswitching of each memorized state is manifested by delivering optical excitations. The high-speed temporal response of terahertz radiation exhibits an on\textendash off\textendash on switching cycle within 16 ps, owing to the defect-rich germanium photoactive layer. By leveraging both degrees of freedom in space and time domains, this multifunctional spatiotemporal metaphotonic device can upgrade and improve the current capabilities of optical computing, data storage, and ultrahigh-speed information processing, paving the way for a highly unexplored territory toward manipulations of light.},

The antenna with a single feeding structure showed a maximum broadside gain of 9.8 dBi, a radiation efficiency of 69\%, and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 16\% (0.34\textendash 0.4 THz). The antenna gain performance was significantly improved by exciting the antenna with an array of slit feeding and without changing the antenna size. The antenna with a multiple (five) feeding structure showed a gain of 15.5 dBi, a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 17.3\%, and a radiation efficiency of 73\%. This antenna achieved a size reduction of 31 times in terms of device thickness in comparison with the design of the lens coupled antenna while achieving a comparable gain. In addition to its high gain and wide-gain-bandwidth characteristics, the proposed antenna design exhibits a low-profile mechanical robustness, easy integration into circuit boards, and excellent low-cost mass production suitability.},

  abstract = {The study of phononic materials and structures is an emerging discipline that lies at the crossroads of vibration and acoustics engineering and condensed matter physics. Broadly speaking, a phononic medium is a material or structural system that usually exhibits some form of periodicity, which can be in the constituent material phases, or the internal geometry, or even the boundary conditions. As such, its overall dynamical characteristics are compactly described by a frequency band structure, in analogy to an electronic band diagram. With roots extended to early studies of periodic systems by Newton and Rayleigh, the field has grown to encompass engineering configurations ranging from trusses and ribbed shells to phononic crystals and metamaterials. While applied research in this area has been abundant in recent years, treatment from a fundamental mechanics perspective, and particularly from the standpoint of dynamical systems, is needed to advance the field in new directions. For example, techniques already developed for the incorporation of damping and nonlinearities have recently been applied to wave propagation in phononic materials and structures. Similarly, numerical and experimental approaches originally developed for the characterization of conventional materials and structures are now being employed toward better understanding and exploitation of phononic systems. This article starts with an overview of historical developments and follows with an in-depth literature and technical review of recent progress in the field with special consideration given to aspects pertaining to the fundamentals of dynamics, vibrations, and acoustics. Finally, an outlook is projected onto the future on the basis of the current trajectories of the field.},

The expansion employs a natural basis composed of a selected reduced set of Bloch eigenfunctions. The reduced basis is selected within the irreducible Brillouin zone at high symmetry points determined by the medium's crystal structure and group theory (and possibly at additional related points). At each of the reciprocal lattice selection points, a number of Bloch eigenfunctions are selected up to the frequency/energy range of interest for the band structure calculations. As it is common to initially discretize the periodic unit cell and solution field using some choice of basis, RBME is practically a secondary expansion that uses a selected set of Bloch eigenvectors. Such expansion therefore keeps, and builds on, any favourable attributes a primary expansion approach might exhibit. Being in line with the well-known concept of modal analysis, the proposed approach maintains accuracy while reducing the computation time by up to two orders of magnitudes or more depending on the size and extent of the calculations. Results are presented for phononic, photonic and electronic band structures.},

Absorption at the plasmon resonance in Au and Ag structures occurs in the visible spectrum, impairing device performance.

  abstract = {Vibration energy harvesters are attracting attention as sensor node power sources for the Internet of Things society because they are maintenance-free. Vibration energy harvesters, which generate power efficiently by utilizing structural resonance, have difficulty in reducing the size of the device and matching low-frequency bands. In this study, a piezoelectric vibrational energy harvester (PVEH) is proposed with mechanical metamaterials for the elastic layer, which has a low resonance frequency and high-power output. We designed the dimensions of the metamaterial structure for the elastic layer of the PVEH, and the bending stiffness was varied by changing the size of the periodic structure of the metamaterial structure to adjust the device's performance. Finite element analysis was performed for four metamaterial PVEHs with different periodic structure sizes. The metamaterial PVEH with the smallest structure had a 16 \% decrease in resonance frequency and 100 \% increase in power generation compared to the metamaterial PVEH with the largest structure. The proposed PVEHs were fabricated by photolithography, and their performance was evaluated by vibration tests. In a sinusoidal excitation with an acceleration of 0.2G, assuming that the vibration is caused by human body motion, the metamaterial PVEH with the smallest structure shows a resonance frequency of 32 Hz and a maximum output power of 1.3 {$\mu$}W. Compared to the conventional flat plate-type PVEH, the resonance frequency is reduced by 48 \% and the power output is 3.2 times higher in the proposed PVEH. An increase in flexibility due to metamaterial structures has an advantage that there is no need to change materials or processing processes as compared with the case of using the low stiffness substrate.},

The ongoing discovery of new classes of tunable optical materials combined with various multiphysics paradigms demands an appropriate computational tool to characterize and design the wave manipulation patterns with the additional degree of freedom (time). Here we present, for the first time, a fast and accurate numerical technique to compute light propagation through patterned layers with spatial and temporal modulation of permittivity by extending the well-established rigorous coupled-wave analysis framework. We expand the electric and magnetic field components of an arbitrarily shaped space-time unit cell into a basis of spatio-temporal harmonics and compute their modal field profiles as a set of eigenmodes of the unit cell. The relation between the wave amplitudes of the incident, reflected, and transmitted spatio-temporal harmonics are then computed by enforcing the boundary conditions at each interface of the pattern. The validity of the proposed method is rigorously verified against the results of a time-variant finite-difference time-domain technique. The applicability of the method to study dielectric and plasmonic time-modulated metasurfaces is exemplified by considering two metasurfaces with spatially-variant phase and frequency of temporal modulation, based on electro-optical modulation of materials such as silicon and graphene. Utilizing the developed technique, we demonstrate some recently reported phenomena associated with time-modulated metasurfaces, such as anomalous steering of higher-order frequency harmonics, and dynamic optical beam generation. Even though we restrict ourselves to one-dimensional patterns for simplicity, the developed method can be flexibly employed for the design, characterization and optimization of two-dimensional spatio-temporal modulation patterns of arbitrary composition and shape.},

Within a suitably designed heterostructure, ferroelectrics display such an NC effect, and various ferroelectricbased microelectronic and nanoelectronic devices have been developed, showing improved performance attributed to NC. However, the exact physical nature of the NC response and direct experimental evidence remain elusive or controversial thus far. In this Review1mu, we discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for ferroelectric NC, tackling static and transient NC responses. We examine ferroelectric responses to voltage and charge, as well as ferroelectric switching, and discuss proof-of-concept experiments and possibilities for device implementation.

  abstract = {Agile materials and technologies based on nonlinear dielectrics like ferroelectrics or liquid crystals offer a line of passive tunable microwave components such as varactors, filters and phase shifters, suitable as key components in phased-array antennas e.g. for automotive radar sensors and in future reconfigurable (frequency-agile) RF-frontends, e.g. in mobile communication systems with multiband operation. The trend towards these commercial microwave applications involves a demand for cheaply integrated, compact devices with both, high tunability and low insertion loss. Therefore, distinct research interests have been focused on agile materials for tunable microwave components as promising alternatives to active semiconductor devices or MEMS varactors. Starting with some results of ferroelectric thin-film devices from literature, the focus of this paper will be on our research of tunable microwave components based on (1) ferroelectric thick-films on Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-substrate and (2) liquid-crystals. Up to now, only very few approaches used an anisotropy at microwaves, e.g. for phase shifting purposes. However, with recently developed, novel highly-anisotropic microwave LCs, a figure-of-merit of above 110/spl deg//dB at 24 GHz has been achieved for a inverted-microstrip line phase shifter with comparatively low control voltages less than 30 V. At the same frequency, this exceeds by far the figure-of-merit of 30 to 50/spl deg//dB of BST-coplanar waveguide phase shifters, however, much lower tuning speed. This substantial progress opens up totally new low-cost LC applications beyond optics.},

The proposed approach could be applied easily to the various configurations of the grating composed of the metal or metal-coated nanocylinders with different types and locations of the excitation sources. Special attention is paid to the three types of resonances: (a) surface plasmon resonances associated with the metal nanocylinders, (b) Rayleigh anomalies related with the periodic nature of the grating, and (c) resonances due to the coupling between the grating and the dielectric substrate. Near-field distribution of the magnetic field, which is parallel to the axis of the nanocylinders, is investigated numerically. Physical insight is given to the localization of the field along the interfaces of the metal nanocylinders, formation of the strong reflected field by the grating, and the field enhancement at the surface of the dielectric substrate. The accuracy of the numerical analyses has been tested based on the principle of the energy conservation. All these features are technologically important and have wide practical application from the viewpoint of the flexible design and fabrication of the plasmonic optical devices.},

An isoparametric 3D electromechanical hexahedral finite element introducing the micromechanical constitutive law for domain switching is proposed to investigate the non-linear response of single crystal piezoceramics. The micromechanical model considered here is based on thermodynamic approach and internal variables, accounting for the electromechanical interaction energy between the domains. The volume fractions of six distinct uni-axial variants are treated as the internal variables to describe the microscopic state of the material at any given loading level. Furthermore, the formulation includes a realistic phase transition from a cubic unit cell to tetragonal one in the single crystal piezoceramics under the application of external load. The non-linear electromechanical constitutive equations obtained are solved using an implicit integration technique employing the return-mapping algorithm. The model developed here is tested for its applicability considering variety of benchmarks, and it brings out the behaviour of piezoceramic materials as observed in experimental studies.The hexahedral finite element presented is also implemented in the commercial finite element code Abaqus via the User Element subroutine.},

Special attention is devoted to the response in frequency ranges with gaps in the band structure for the corresponding infinite periodic lattice. The effects of boundaries, viscous damping, and imperfections are studied by analyzing two examples; a 1-D filter and a 2-D wave guide. In 1-D the structural response in the band gap is shown to be insensitive to damping and small imperfections. In 2-D the similar effect of damping is noted for one type of periodic structure, whereas for another type the band gap effect is nearly eliminated by damping. In both 1-D and 2-D it is demonstrated how the free structural boundaries affect the response in the band gap due to local resonances. Finally, 2-D wave guides are considered by replacing the periodic structure with a homogeneous structure in a straight and a 90\textdegree{} bent path, and it is shown how the vibrational response is confined to the paths in the band gap frequency ranges.},

  abstract = {Phase-change phenomena have been an attractive research theme for decades due to the dynamic transition of material properties providing extraordinary capabilities for versatile optical device applications. Even at the terahertz (THz) frequency regime, phase-change materials (PCMs) promote the development of dynamic devices, especially when combined with a plasmonic approach delivering strong field enhancement and localization. According to the design of plasmonic metamaterials or hybrid composites, PCMs can actively modulate the electromagnetic properties of THz waves through thermal, electrical, and optical means. In turn, THz waves can affect the PCM properties in the nonlinear regime due to the intense field strength enhancement by plasmonic structures. Here, a few types of PCMs demonstrating promising potential in THz plasmonic applications are introduced. Starting from the best-known transition metal oxide, vanadium dioxide (VO2), which possesses an insulator-to-metal phase transition near room temperature, superconductors, chalcogenides, ferroelectrics, liquid crystals, and liquid metals are covered along with their phase-change properties and the control mechanisms infused with THz plasmonic applications. The corresponding recent progress presenting how PCMs combined with plasmonic structures can demonstrate effective THz modulation is reviewed. This general overview may provide a better understanding of dynamic THz plasmonics and new ideas for future THz technology.},

Training is performed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of outputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for backpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and angles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can utilize gradients to improve performance.},

The recently developed metamaterials provide efficient approaches to generate a perfect optical illusion. However, all existing research on metamaterial illusions has been limited to theory and numerical simulations. Here, we propose the concept of a radar illusion, which can make the electromagnetic (EM) image of a target gathered by radar look like a different target, and we realize a radar illusion device experimentally to change the radar image of a metallic target into a dielectric target with predesigned size and material parameters. It is well known that the radar signatures of metallic and dielectric objects are significantly different. However, when a metallic target is enclosed by the proposed illusion device, its EM scattering characteristics will be identical to that of a predesigned dielectric object under the illumination of radar waves. Such an illusion device will confuse the radar, and hence the real EM properties of the metallic target cannot be perceived. We designed and fabricated the radar illusion device using artificial metamaterials in the microwave frequency, and good illusion performances are observed in the experimental results.},

The loss function used for backpropagation depends on the generated pattern layouts, their efficiencies, and efficiency gradients, which are calculated by the adjoint variables method using forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations. We observe that the distribution of devices generated by the network continuously shifts towards high performance design space regions over the course of optimization. Upon training completion, the best generated devices have efficiencies comparable to or exceeding the best devices designed using standard topology optimization. Our proposed global optimization algorithm can generally apply to other gradient-based optimization problems in optics, mechanics, and electronics.},

  abstract = {Magnetic permeability, which measures the response of a material to an applied magnetic field, is crucial to the performance of magnetic devices and related technologies. Its dynamic value is usually a complex number with real and imaginary parts that describe, respectively, how much magnetic power can be stored and lost in the material. Control of permeability is therefore closely related to energy redistribution within a magnetic system or energy exchange between magnetic and other degrees of freedom via certain spin-dependent interactions. To avoid a high power consumption, direct manipulation of the permeability with an electric field through magnetoelectric coupling leads to high efficiency and simple operation, but remains a big challenge in both the fundamental physics and material science. Here we report unambiguous evidence of ferroelectric control of dynamic magnetic permeability in a Co/Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)0.7Ti0.3O3 (Co/PMN-PT) heterostructure, in which the ferroelectric PMN-PT acts as an energy source for the ferromagnetic Co film via an interfacial linear magnetoelectric interaction. The electric field tuning of the magnitude and line shape of the permeability offers a highly localized means of controlling magnetization with ultralow power consumption. Additionally, the emergence of negative permeability promises a new way of realizing functional nanoscale metamaterials with adjustable refraction index.}

  abstract = {It was mainly during the last two decades that the theory of homogenization or averaging of partial differential equations took shape as a distinct mathe\- matical discipline. This theory has a lot of important applications in mechanics of composite and perforated materials, filtration, disperse media, and in many other branches of physics, mechanics and modern technology. There is a vast literature on the subject. The term averaging has been usually associated with the methods of non\- linear mechanics and ordinary differential equations developed in the works of Poincare, Van Der Pol, Krylov, Bogoliubov, etc. For a long time, after the works of Maxwell and Rayleigh, homogeniza\- tion problems for{$\cdot$} partial differential equations were being mostly considered by specialists in physics and mechanics, and were staying beyond the scope of mathematicians. A great deal of attention was given to the so called disperse media, which, in the simplest case, are two-phase media formed by the main homogeneous material containing small foreign particles (grains, inclusions). Such two-phase bodies, whose size is considerably larger than that of each sep\- arate inclusion, have been discovered to possess stable physical properties (such as heat transfer, electric conductivity, etc.) which differ from those of the con\- stituent phases. For this reason, the word homogenized, or effective, is used in relation to these characteristics. An enormous number of results, approximation formulas, and estimates have been obtained in connection with such problems as electromagnetic wave scattering on small particles, effective heat transfer in two-phase media, etc.},

Therefore, time-efficient approximate models can be particularly beneficial for the evaluation when evolutionary algorithms are applied. In this paper, the convergence property of an evolution strategy (ES) with neural network based fitness evaluations is investigated. It is found that the evolutionary algorithm will converge incorrectly if the approximate model has false optima. To address this problem, two strategies to control the evolution process are introduced. In addition, methods to eliminate false minima in neural network training are proposed. The effectiveness of the methods are shown with simulation studies on the Ackley function and the Rosenbrock function.},

However, previous studies on planar chiroptical effects were limited by the mechanism of enhancing the CD effect. In this paper, a narrow gap is designed between two single planar L-shaped nanorods to facilitate gap plasmon coupling and induce the splitting of the quadrupole mode. This splitting can enhance the circular dichroism (CD) effect. Simulated results also proclaim that CD properties are manipulated by geometrical parameters. The structural design and the new mechanism of the CD effect may provide a novel method for chiral manipulations of light and chiral optical devices.},

In addition, the concept of symmetric design sensitivity mapping is introduced for multi-directional cloaking effect.

The strained film exhibits a pronounced dependence of its permittivity on the bias, which exerts a strong influence on the resonance. Specifically, the resonance of our structure occurs near 0.5 THz and, upon applying a bias voltage of 55 V, a relative tunability of the resonance frequency of 19\% was achieved at room temperature.},

From several promising 3D manufacturing techniques for realizing different classes of structures suitable for various applications, interference lithography with diffractive masks stands out for its potential to fabricate complex structures at fast speeds. However, the interference lithography masks demonstrated generally suffer from limitations in terms of the patterns that can be generated. To overcome some of these limitations, here we propose the metasurface-mask\textendash assisted 3D nanofabrication which provides great freedom in patterning various periodic structures. To showcase the versatility of this platform, we design metasurface masks that generate exotic periodic lattices like gyroid, rotated cubic, and diamond structures. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate a diffractive element that can generate the diamond lattice.},

The library uses a global variant of B\'ezier extraction to avoid modifying the finite element assembly procedures of FEniCS. This makes much of the convenient functionality of FEniCS directly available for IGA. General rational splines are implemented through an abstraction that sees only an extracted representation of the IGA function space. Through this abstraction, an enormous variety of spline spaces can be used for analysis, so long as a corresponding preprocessor is developed for each one, implementing a simple interface. As examples, we discuss preprocessors for B-splines specified analytically, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) designed using the open-source software igakit, and T-splines designed using commercial software. We then demonstrate the implementation of solvers for several non-trivial partial differential equations that benefit from IGA. We also evaluate the parallel performance of tIGAr on a distributed-memory supercomputer. Finally, we outline possibilities for further development of IGA in FEniCS.

In this paper we motivate and verify the one-dimensional formulation of such a model. It relies upon introducing the remanent polarization and the remanent strain as internal variables besides stress, strain, electric field and polarization. The internal variables are governed by ordinary differential equations. Each of these evolution equations is subjected to two loading conditions of different nature. The first one indicates the onset of changes of the remanent quantities by domain switching, while the second one characterizes the saturation value of a remanent quantity corresponding to a totally switched domain structure. Polarization induced anisotropy is taken into account as far as it seemed necessary. For simplicity, no rate effects are included. The model response to uniaxial electro-mechanical loading histories will be discussed in comparison to known experimental results. By means of a bilinear approximation the following characteristic phenomena of macroscopic ferroelectricity are represented : dielectric hysteresis, polarization induced piezoelectricity, butterfly hysteresis, ferroelastic hysteresis, mechanical depolarization.},

The software makes use of the asymptotic expansion form of the inner kinematic and static variables of the lattice structure, exploiting its spatial periodicity. As such, it makes use of the smallest repetitive material unit, substantially reducing the cost of full-scale computations. For the identification of the basic cell's parameters, a dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) is provided. The Python code computes the complete linear elasticity stiffness and compliance matrix based on Cauchy mechanics, providing access to all relevant material moduli. In particular, the normal, shear and bulk moduli, as well as the Poisson's ratio and relative density values of the architectured material structure are elaborated. Its formulation favors the analysis of a wide range of lattice designs, establishing a fundamental link between micro- and macro-scale material properties.},

Since it is not available in nature, a variety of growth methods has been employed to produce in large scale, with high quality and low-cost. BaTiO3, as a metal oxide meets practical requirements such as physical hardness, stability and tunable optoelectronic properties. The plethora of characteristics renders it functional in diverse fields of applications from energy harvesting to biophotonics. Related to optical properties, it is a dielectric material from the near ultraviolet to the near-infrared part of the spectrum with low optical losses and relatively high refractive index. The strong second-order nonlinear response has resulted in several breakthroughs in bioimaging, while its intrinsic electrooptic response is among the highest within the existing materials. The properties of the BaTiO3 may also be modified by doping or hybridization with other materials. This review presents the basic optoelectronic properties of BaTiO3, reports on the recent advances in BaTiO3 nanostructures and thin films related to photonic applications, and oversees photonic technologies that may benefit from this material platform in the near future.},

A unique class of flat optical components with high functionality can be designed by introducing abrupt phase shifts into the optical path, utilizing the resonant response of arrays of scatterers with deeply subwavelength thickness. As an application of this concept, we report a theoretical and experimental study of birefringent arrays of two-dimensional (V- and Y-shaped) optical antennas which support two orthogonal charge-oscillation modes and serve as broadband, anisotropic optical elements that can be used to locally tailor the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. The degree of optical anisotropy can be designed by controlling the interference between the waves scattered by the antenna modes; in particular, we observe a striking effect in which the anisotropy disappears as a result of destructive interference. These properties are captured by a simple, physical model in which the antenna modes are treated as independent, orthogonally oriented harmonic oscillators.},

The scalar function is then regularized by a PDE based filter. Several image-processing based filtering techniques have so far been proposed for regularization or restricting the minimum length scale. They are conventionally applied to the design sensitivities rather than the design variables themselves. However, it causes discrepancies between the filtered sensitivities and the actual sensitivities that may confuse the optimization process and disturb the convergence. In this paper, we propose a Heaviside projection based topology optimization method with a scalar function that is filtered by a Helmholtz type partial differential equation. Therefore, the optimality can be strictly discussed in terms of the KKT condition. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a minimum compliance problem is solved.},

  abstract = {Design of efficient thin film photovoltaic (PV) cells require optical power absorption to be computed inside a nano-scale structure of photovoltaics, dielectric and plasmonic materials. Calculating power absorption requires Maxwell's electromagnetic equations which are solved using numerical methods, such as finite difference time domain (FDTD). The computational cost of thin film PV cell design and optimization is therefore cumbersome, due to successive FDTD simulations. This cost can be reduced using a surrogate-based optimization procedure. In this study, we deploy neural networks (NNs) to model optical absorption in organic PV structures. We use the corresponding surrogate-based optimization procedure to maximize light trapping inside thin film organic cells infused with metallic particles. Metallic particles are known to induce plasmonic effects at the metal\textendash semiconductor interface, thus increasing absorption. However, a rigorous design procedure is required to achieve the best performance within known design guidelines. As a result of using NNs to model thin film solar absorption, the required time to complete optimization is decreased by more than five times. The obtained NN model is found to be very reliable. The optimization procedure results in absorption enhancement greater than 200\%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that once a reliable surrogate model such as the developed NN is available, it can be used for alternative analyses on the proposed design, such as uncertainty analysis (e.g., fabrication error).},

Composites are analyzed through the use of a computational homogenization framework for phase field methods proposed in Z\"ah \& Miehe [2]. This will give insights into the coupled phenomena taking place on the microscale and on their relation to the overall behavior. Both will be of special interest for the development of advanced composite materials with tailored properties like, for example, particulate magneto-electric composites, which are composed of a ferroelectric matrix and magnetic rare-earth elements or metals. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of ferroelectric polycrystals with a focus on size effects. This will enable us to reveal preferred microstructure configurations depending on the system and grain size. In addition to that, it will serve as basis for the extraction of the directional properties of polycrystals with respect to their switching behavior in the different grains of the polycrystal. Associated simulations could then be used to supply coarser models with the needed directional informations. (\textcopyright{} 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

Besides their broadband birefringence and transparency, abilities to self-assemble into various crystalline phases and to conform to various flexible forms and shapes, liquid crystals are compatible with almost all other optoelectronic materials and technology platforms. In both isotropic and ordered phases, liquid crystals possess extraordinarily large optical nonlinearities that stretch over multiple time scales. To date, almost all conceivable nonlinear optical phenomena have been observed in a very broad spectrum spanning the entire visible to infrared and beyond. In this review, we present a self-contained complete discussion of the optical nonlinearities of liquid crystals, and a thorough review of a wide range of nonlinear optical processes and phenomena enabled by these unique properties. Starting with a brief historical account of the development of nonlinear optical studies of the mesophases of liquid crystals, we then review various liquid crystalline materials and structures, and their nonlinear optical properties. Emphasis is placed on the nematic phase, which best exemplifies the dual nature of liquid crystals, although frequent references to other phases are also made. We also delve into recent work on novel structures such as photonic crystals, metamaterials and nanostructures and their special characteristics and emergent properties. The mechanisms and complex nonlocal dynamics of optical nonlinearities associated with laser induced director axis reorientation, thermal, density, and order parameter fluctuations, space charge field formation and photorefractivity are critically reviewed as a foundation for the discussions of various nonlinear optical processes detailed in this paper.},

This approach uses training data obtained through full-wave EM simulations of a series of nanostructures to train geometric deep learning algorithms to assess the range of feasible responses as well as the feasibility of a desired response from a class of EM nanostructures. To facilitate the knowledge discovery, this approach combines the dimensionality reduction technique with convex-hull and one-class support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithms to find the range of the feasible responses in the latent response space of the EM nanostructure. More importantly, the one-class SVM algorithm can be trained to provide the degree of feasibility of a response from a given nanostructure. This important information can be used to modify the initial structure to an alternative one that can enable an initially unfeasible response. To show the applicability of this approach, it is applied to two important classes of binary metasurfaces (MSs), formed by an array of plasmonic nanostructures, and periodic MSs formed by an array of dielectric nanopillars. These theoretical and experimental results confirm the unique features of this approach for knowledge discovery in EM nanostructures.},

We present the application of three nature-inspired stochastic optimization techniques in conjunction with fast numerical electromagnetic solvers to yield a metamaterial that satisfies a required design criterion. In particular, three stochastic optimization tools (genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing) are used for designing a low-loss optical negative index metamaterial. A negative refractive index around -0.8+0.2i is obtained at a wavelength of 770 nm. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is found to be the most efficient in this case.},

They are typically designed by hand based on careful analysis of their bands and mode profiles, but recent theoretical advances have revealed new and powerful insights into the connection between band symmetry, connectivity, and topology. Here we propose a combined global and local optimization framework that integrates a flexible symmetry-constrained level-set parameterization with standard gradient-free optimization algorithms to optimize topological photonic crystals, a problem setting where the objective function may be highly non-convex and non-continuous. Our framework can be applied to any symmetry-identifiable band topology, and we demonstrate its applicability to several prominent kinds of three-dimensional band topology, namely \$\textbackslash Gamma\$-enforced nodal lines, Weyl points, and Chern insulators. Requiring no prior examples of topological photonic crystals or prior knowledge on the connection between structure and band topology, our approach indicates a path towards the automated discovery of novel topological photonic crystal designs.},

Here we demonstrate electrically programmable nonvolatile memory metadevices realised by the hybridization of graphene, a ferroelectric and meta-atoms/meta-molecules, and extend the concept further to establish reconfigurable logic-gate metadevices. For a memory metadevice having a single electrical input, amplitude, phase and even the polarization multi-states were clearly distinguishable with a retention time of over 10 years at room temperature. Furthermore, logic-gate functionalities were demonstrated with reconfigurable logic-gate metadevices having two electrical inputs, with each connected to separate ferroelectric layers that act as the multi-level controller for the doping level of the sandwiched graphene layer.},

When the tilt angle is nonzero, the wave transmission and absorption show an asymmetry under the sign change of the incident angle in a range of the tilt angle, while the reflection is always symmetric. We calculate the reflectance, the transmittance and the absorptance for several configurations of the permittivity tensor and find that resonant absorption is greatly enhanced when the medium from the incident surface to the resonance region is hyperbolic than when it is elliptic. For certain configurations, the transmittance and absorptance curves display sharp peaks at some incident angles determined by the tilt angle.},

  abstract = {Energy harvesting devices are smart structures capable of converting the mechanical energy (generally, in the form of vibrations) that would be wasted otherwise in the environment into usable electrical energy. Laminated piezoelectric plate and shell structures have been largely used in the design of these devices because of their large generation areas. The design of energy harvesting devices is complex, and they can be efficiently designed by using topology optimization methods (TOM). In this work, the design of laminated piezocomposite energy harvesting devices has been studied using TOM. The energy harvesting performance is improved by maximizing the effective electric power generated by the piezoelectric material, measured at a coupled electric resistor, when subjected to a harmonic excitation. However, harmonic vibrations generate mechanical stress distribution that, depending on the frequency and the amplitude of vibration, may lead to piezoceramic failure. This study advocates using a global stress constraint, which accounts for different failure criteria for different types of materials (isotropic, piezoelectric, and orthotropic). Thus, the electric power is maximized by optimally distributing piezoelectric material, by choosing its polarization sign, and by properly choosing the fiber angles of composite materials to satisfy the global stress constraint. In the TOM formulation, the Piezoelectric Material with Penalization and Polarization material model is applied to distribute piezoelectric material and to choose its polarization sign, and the Discrete Material Optimization method is applied to optimize the composite fiber orientation. The finite element method is adopted to model the structure with a piezoelectric multilayered shell element. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology.

Fluids are well described by the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10\texttimes{} finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

The phase change also causes a drop in the material's resistivity by six orders of magnitude. In this study, two GeTe-incorporated SRR designs were investigated. The first was an SRR made entirely out of GeTe and the second was a gold SRR structure with a GeTe film incorporated into the gap region of the split ring.

By using the Hamilton's principle, the equations of motion considering the material length scale parameter and the effects of voltage for the piezoelectric micro-plate have been derived based on the Kirchhoff's plate model. The equations have been solved by applying the GDQR as a semi-analytical method for different boundary conditions. The static and free vibration behaviors of the micro-cantilever are investigated to signify the size effect, piezoelectric properties and external voltage. The results indicate when the material length scale parameter is comparable with plate thickness; the size effect will be significant. By separating the effects of the induced electrical field to the voltage effects and the structural effects of the piezoelectric material, the influence of the applied voltage on vibration frequency as well as the size effects at different boundary conditions have been investigated. Also it is shown that in the piezoelectric micro-cantilever the voltage effect on the size-dependent natural frequency differs significantly for the positive and negative applied voltage.},

As compared to the number of studies dealing with the aforementioned case, research on 2D structures with an attached piezoceramic patch harvester is very limited. Thus, an analytical modeling and experimental validations of a piezo harvester structurally integrated on a thin plate with SFSF (Simply supported-Free-Simply supported-Free) boundary conditions is presented in this paper. The distributed parameter electroelastic model of a harvester bonded to an aluminum plate with both piezo-patch actuators is developed on the basis of the Kirchhoff plate theory and the modal analysis for physical and modal coordinates. This allows to estimate the steady-state value output voltage for each odd mode in the frequency range of 10\textendash 300 Hz. Finally, the obtained results for the electroelastic analytical model is experimentally verified on a laboratory stand.},

Most previous perturbative methods give incorrect results for this case, even to lowest order, because of the complicated discontinuous boundary conditions on the electric field at such an interface. Our final expression is simply a surface integral, over the material interface, of the continuous field components from the unperturbed structure. The derivation is based on a ``localized'' coordinate-transformation technique, which avoids both the problem of field discontinuities and the challenge of constructing an explicit coordinate transformation by taking the limit in which the coordinate perturbation is infinitesimally localized around the boundary. Not only is our result potentially useful in evaluating boundary perturbations, e.g., from fabrication imperfections, in highly anisotropic media such as many metamaterials, but it also has a direct application in numerical electromagnetism. In particular, we show how it leads to a subpixel smoothing scheme to ameliorate staircasing effects in discretized simulations of anisotropic media, in such a way as to greatly reduce the numerical errors compared to other proposed smoothing schemes.},

This study presents a planar meta-lens based on the phase gradient vanadium dioxide composite metasurface controlled by an external thermal stimulus that enables the switchable focusing. By utilizing the insulator-metal phase transition characteristics of the vanadium dioxide components, the composite metasurface can show a different phase gradient distribution that could lead to various focuses. Both simulated and experimental results demonstrate that without the external stimulus, the vanadium dioxide components display dielectric characteristics that are a phase-transparent response to THz wave. While applying an external thermal stimulus, the phase transition leads to the metallization of vanadium dioxide components that could induce the redistribution of the phase gradient of the metasurface to realize a tunable focusing. The measurements show that the results are in line with our expectations and achieve three times the tunable focal length variation from 2.5 mm with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.78 to 7.5 mm with an NA of 0.39 at 0.65 THz, which was reversible. The proposed switchable planar metalens is expected to deliver a promising new design for electromagnetic wave dynamic manipulation and enable active applications, such as dynamic imaging or other optical systems at THz frequencies.},

Space mapping takes several forms. Here, we present and formulate the original input space mapping concept, as well as the more recent implicit and output space mapping concepts. Corresponding surrogate models are presented, classified, and discussed. A proposed optimization flow is explained. Then we illustrate both input space mapping and implicit space mapping through the space mapping optimization of a simple, technology-free wedgecutting problem.

Through a dynamic grain-orientation-reassignment routine, the computational algorithm avoids grain growth via coalescence, thus eliminating the dependence of the simulation results on the number of order parameters implemented in the phase-field description of the polycrystalline microstructure. Consequently, far fewer order-parameter values must be computed than in previous formulations of the phase-field model, which permits handling simulation cells large enough to contain a statistically significant number of grains. The kinetic and topological properties of the microstructure induced by coarsening closely resemble those obtained by other methods for simulating coalescence-free grain growth in 3D.

Infolgedessen m\"ussen wesentlich weniger Ordnungsparameterwerte berechnet werden als in fr\"uheren Formulierungen des Phasenfeldmodells, was es gestattet, Simulationszellen zu behandeln, die gro\ss{} genug sind, um eine statistisch signifikante Anzahl von K\"ornern zu beinhalten. Die kinetischen und topologischen Eigenschaften der durch Vergr\"oberung induzierten Mikrostruktur \"ahneln denjenigen, die durch andere Methoden zur dreidimensionalen Simulierung koaleszensfreien Kornwachstums erhalten wurden.},

We use our method within a variational mean-field theory to connect with Landau theory and show through comparison with numerically exact simulations that (a) the state constrained to have vanishing order (away from the equilibrium) below the transition temperature is highly degenerate due to fluctuations that drive the phase transition first order, and (b) certain terms need to be added to the phenomenological Landau-Devonshire free-energy functions to capture the physics of spatial fluctuation in order parameter.

Transformation optical devices exploit the form invariance of Maxwell's equations, allowing geometry to play the dominant role in the design process rather than traditional wave or ray optics. The use of coordinate transformations vastly eases the burden of design for a large class of devices, though at the expense of increasing the complexity of the underlying materials used. Although the required constitutive parameters of a transformation optical structure can be challenging-inherently anisotropic and spatially varying, with both magnetic and electric response-nevertheless the parameter requirements can often be met or approximated through the use of artificially structured metamaterials. Here, we review the basic concepts associated with transformation optics and provide several examples to illustrate its application.},

The simple idea that the position where the Bragg condition is locally satisfied is where reflection takes place is only true in part. Here, reflection is due to a region where the waves are forced to become evanescent, and the rate of variation of structure determines over which distance the waves decay and therefore how complete reflection is. The approximate local Bragg-de Vries schemes are shown to break down in detail at the edges of the gap, and an analytical estimate is given for the transmission coefficient.},

A set of auxiliary evanescent surface waves are introduced and optimized over the entire surface to make the metasurface pointwise passive and lossless. Example 2D designs in TE polarization show that desired scattered fields are established immediately away from the illusion device surface.

Here, we show that the metasurface nonlocality can be engineered to enable signal manipulation in the momentum domain over an ultrathin platform.

This part involves a feedforward neural network, containing adjustable parameters (the weights).

We review our recent efforts for implementing efficient and accurate QNM solvers for computing and normalizing the QNMs of micro- and nanoresonators made of highly dispersive materials. We benchmark several methods for three geometries, a two-dimensional plasmonic crystal, a two-dimensional metal grating, and a three-dimensional nanopatch antenna on a metal substrate, with the perspective to elaborate standards for the computation of resonance modes.},

Meanwhile, they are usually fabricated on flat and rigid substrates, and consequently their applications are restricted. Here, a simple approach is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to obtain a flexible and tunable THz all-dielectric metasurface. In this metasurface, micro ceramic spheres (ZrO2) are embedded in a ferroelectric (strontium titanate) / elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane) composite. It is shown that the Mie resonances in micro ceramic spheres can be thermally and reversibly tuned resulting from the temperature dependent permittivity of the ferroelectric / PDMS composite. This metasurface characterized by flexibility and tunability is expected to have a more extensive application in active THz devices.},

However, active and fast tuning of their properties, such as amplitude, phase, and operating frequency, remains challenging. Here, a generic method is proposed for obtaining high-efficiency active AMs from the terahertz to optical ranges by using ``hybrid structures'' integrated with phase-change materials. Various phase-change mechanisms including metal\textendash insulator phase change, nonvolatile phase change, and ferroelectric phase change are investigated. We first experimentally demonstrate several high-efficiency active AMs operating in the terahertz range based on hybrid structures composed of free-standing silicon microstructures covered with ultrathin phase-change nanofilms (thickness d {$\ll$} {$\lambda$}). We show that both the frequencies and the strength of the Mie resonances can be efficiently tuned, resulting in unprecedented modulation depth. Furthermore, detailed analyses of available phase-change materials and their properties are provided to offer more options for active AMs. Finally, several feasible hybrid structures for active AMs in the optical range are proposed and confirmed numerically. The broad platform built in this work for active manipulation of waves from the terahertz to optical ranges may have numerous potential applications in optical devices including switches, modulators, and sensors.},

The use of the distributed shape derivative is facilitated by FEniCS, which allows to handle complicated partial differential equations with a simple implementation. The code is written in the framework of linearized elasticity, and can be easily adapted to tackle other functionals and partial differential equations. We also provide an extension of the code for compliant mechanisms. We start by explaining how to compute shape derivatives, and briefly discuss the differences between the distributed and boundary expressions of the shape derivative. Then we describe the implementation in details, and show the application of this code to some classical benchmarks of topology optimization.

Previously, this approach has been successfully applied as a sensitivity filter. The usual filtering techniques in topology optimization require information about the neighbor cells, which is difficult to obtain for fine meshes or complex domains and geometries. The complexity of the problem increases further in parallel computing, when the design domain is decomposed into multiple non-overlapping partitions. Obtaining information from the neighbor subdomains is an expensive operation. The proposed filter technique requires only mesh information necessary for the finite element discretization of the problem. The main idea is to define the filtered variable implicitly as a solution of a Helmholtz-type differential equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The properties of the filter are demonstrated for various 2D and 3D topology optimization problems in linear elasticity, solved on serial and parallel computers.

Subwavelength spatial control of both amplitude and phase of light is an essential requirement for an ideal hologram. However, traditional holographic devices suffer from their restricted capabilities of incomplete modulation in both amplitude and phase of visible light; this results in sacrifice of optical information and undesirable occurrences of critical noises in holographic images. Herein, we have proposed a novel metasurface that is capable of completely controlling both the amplitude and phase profiles of visible light independently with subwavelength spatial resolution. The full, continuous, and broadband control of both amplitude and phase was achieved using X-shaped meta-atoms based on the expanded concept of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase. The first experimental demonstrations of the complete complex-amplitude holograms with subwavelength definition at visible wavelengths were achieved, and excellent performances with a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio as compared to those of traditional phase-only holograms were obtained. Extraordinary control capability with versatile advantages of our metasurface paves a way to an ideal holography, which is expected to be a significant advancement in the field of optical holography and metasurfaces.},

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that circular dichroism (CD) signals from chiral molecules can be boosted by plasmonic nanostructures inducing strong local electromagnetic fields. To optimize nanostructures to improve CD enhancement, numerical simulations such as the finite element method (FEM) have been widely adopted. However, FEM calculations for CD have been frequently hampered by unwanted numerical artifacts due to improperly discretizing problem spaces. Here, we introduce a new meshing rule for FEM that provides CD simulations with superior numerical accuracy. We show that unwanted numerical artifacts can be suppressed by implementing the mirror-symmetric mesh configuration that generates identical numerical artifacts in the two-opposite circularly polarized waves, which cancel each other out in the final CD result. By applying our meshing scheme, we demonstrate a nanostructure/chiral molecule coupled system from which the CD signal is significantly enhanced. Since our meshing scheme addresses the previously unresolved issue of discriminating between very small CD signals and numerical errors, it can be directly applied to numerical simulations featuring natural chiral molecules which have intrinsically weak chiroptical responses.},

Specifically, solutions are presented for three classes of microstructures: (i) an isotropic iterative microstructure wherein the particles are infinitely polydisperse in size, (ii) an isotropic distribution of polydisperse spherical particles of a finite number of different sizes, and (iii) an isotropic distribution of monodisperse spherical particles. The solution for the iterative microstructure, which corresponds to the viscosity solution of a Hamilton\textendash Jacobi equation in five ``space'' variables, is constructed by means of a novel high-order WENO finite-difference scheme. On the other hand, the solutions for the microstructures with spherical particles are constructed by means of hybrid finite elements. Prompted by the functional features shared by all three obtained solutions, a simple closed-form approximation is proposed for the macroscopic elastic dielectric response of ideal elastic dielectric composites with any type of (non-percolative) isotropic particulate microstructure. As elaborated in a companion paper, the proposed approximate solution proves particularly useful as a fundamental building block to generate approximate solutions for the macroscopic elastic dielectric response of dielectric elastomer composites made up of non-Gaussian dielectric elastomers filled with nonlinear elastic dielectric particles.},

Among them, quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO) can be applied to minimize anisotropy of transformed media and has opened up the possibility to the design of broadband antennas with arbitrary geometries. In this work, a wide-angle scanning conformal phased array based on all-dielectric QCTO lens is designed and experimentally demonstrated. Excited by the same current distribution as such in a conventional planar array, the conformal system in presence of QCTO lens can preserve the same radiation characteristics of a planar array with wide-angle beam-scanning and low side lobe level (SLL). Laplace's equation subject to Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions is adopted to construct the mapping between the virtual and physical spaces. The isotropic lens with graded refractive index is realized by all-dielectric holey structure after an effective parameter approximation. The measurements of the fabricated system agree well with the simulated results, which demonstrate its excellent wide-angle beam scanning performance. Such demonstration paves the way to a robust but efficient array synthesis, as well as multi-beam and beam forming realization of conformal arrays via transformation optics.},

First, the functional relationship between the porosity p, the number of seed points n, and the beam radius r is established. The design space is then divided into individual unit cells, and the seed points and beam radius values of each unit cell are calculated. In each unit cell, Voronoi tessellation is used to generate uniformly distributed seed points. Finally in the design space, all seed points are Voronoi tessellated globally, and the edges are cylindered with corresponding beam radius values. With this design method, not only can the lattice structures with uniform or graded distribution of porosity be generated, but the customized lattice structures can also be generated according to the porosity of each unit cell. Through the analysis of model data, it is verified that the uniform distribution of seed points in this paper is stable and the porosity of the model is consistent with the design value. The distribution of pore spheres between pores is used to illustrate that the lattice porous structures designed in this paper is globally controllable and locally uniform.},

Here, we focus on the physics of a medium with finite dimensions consisting on a square lattice of parallel conducting wires arranged on a sub-wavelength scale. This medium supports electromagnetic fields that vary much faster than the operating wavelength. We show that such modes are dispersive due to the finiteness of the medium. Their dispersion relation is established in a simple way, a link with designer plasmons is made, and the canalization phenomenon is reinterpreted at the light of our model. We explain how to take advantage of this dispersion in order to code sub-wavelength wave fields in time. Finally, we show that the resonant nature of the medium ensures an efficient coupling of these modes with free space propagating waves and, thanks to the Purcell effect, with a source placed in the near field of the medium.},

All of the previous proposals for invisibility require materials with extreme properties. Here we show that transformation optics of a curved, non-Euclidean space (such as the surface of a virtual sphere) relax these requirements and can lead to invisibility in a broad band of the spectrum. In theory, materials with a negative refractive index deployed in a curved, non-Euclidean space can provide a route to cloaking and invisibility across a range of wavelengths.

Such mechanical and/or electric multi-field interactions allow symmetry breaking of the rotationally invariant switching field and cause a variety of complicated instability phenomena in ferroelectric systems, e.g., super switching of in-plane ferroelectric nanodomains in strained thin films, labile and ultrafast switching of ferroelastic nanodomains, and ferroelectric polarization reversal via successive ferroelastic transitions. To systematically understand the nature of instabilities in ferroelectrics, here, we propose an analytical method based on Ginzburg-Landau theory to enable rigorous description of any type of instability in arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures under a finite electric field and/or mechanical loading. The present theory yields, as an instability criterion, the condition that the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of potential energy with respect to displacements, electrical potential, and polarization vectors must be zero. In addition, the corresponding eigenvector represents the polarization behavior at the onset of instability, which is successfully validated by application of the criterion to domain switching and successive ferroelastic transitions in PbTiO3 ferroelectric thin film under electrical and mechanical excitation, respectively. This approach thus provides a novel insight into the cause of instability in ferroelectrics. In addition, the proposed criterion is scale-independent, which enables elucidation of the nature of various types of instability in arbitrary ferroelectric systems so that complicated instability issues in practical situations can be addressed.},

A plethora of topological field structures have been discovered in magnetic and ordered soft matter systems due to the presence of inherent chiral interactions, and this has provided a fruitful platform for unearthing additional groundbreaking functionalities. However, despite being one of the most important classes of ordered systems, ferroelectrics scarcely form topological polarization structures due to their lack of intrinsic chiral interactions. In the present study, we demonstrate using multiphysics phase-field modelling based on the Ginzburg\textendash Landau theory that a rich assortment of nontrivial topological polarization structures, including hedgehogs, antivortices, multidirectional vortices, and vortex arrays, can be spontaneously formed in three-dimensional nanoporous ferroelectric structures. We realize that confining ferroelectrics to trivial geometries that are incompatible with the orientation symmetry may impose extrinsic frustration to the polarization field through the enhancement of depolarization fields at free porous surfaces. This frustration gives rise to symmetry breaking, resulting in the formation of nontrivial topological polarization structures as the ground state. We further topologically characterize the local accommodation of polarization structures by viewing them in a new perspective, in which polarization ordering can be mapped on the order parameter space, according to the topological theory of defects and homotopy theory. The results indicate that the nanoporous structures contain composite topological objects composed of two or more elementary topological polarization structures. The present study therefore offers a playground for exploring novel physical phenomena in ferroelectric systems as well as a novel nanoelectronics characterization platform for future topology-based nanotechnologies.},

  abstract = {Numerical evidence is presented that shows that, for metallic lamellar gratings in TM polarization, the coupled-wave method formulated by Moharam and Gaylord [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A3, 1780 ( 1986)] converges slowly. (In some cases, for achieving a relative error of less than 1\% in diffraction efficiencies, the number of spatial harmonics retained in the computation must be much greater than 100.) By classification of the modal methods for analyzing diffraction gratings into two distinct categories, the cause for the slow convergence is analyzed and attributed to the use of Fourier expansions to represent the permittivity and the electromagnetic fields in the grating region. The eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the modal fields in the grating region, whose accurate determination is crucial to the success of the coupled-wave method, are shown to converge slowly as a result of the use of these Fourier expansions. Despite its versatility and simplicity, the coupled-wave method should be used with caution for metallic surface-relief gratings in TM polarization.},

Twenty finite element models are constructed for each type of honeycomb samples (specimens) to obtain the mean values and standard deviations of the effective elastic properties. Spatially periodic boundary conditions are applied to each specimen containing 360 complete cells. The simulation results indicate that the elastic moduli increase as cell shapes become more irregular, but decrease as cell wall thickness gets less uniform. The Poisson's ratios are insignificantly affected by the presence of these two types of imperfections. The effect of the interaction between the co-existing cell shape and cell wall thickness imperfections on the elastic moduli is found to be weak. Bending remains as the dominant deformation mechanism in a loaded honeycomb having irregular cell shapes and/or non-uniform cell wall thickness. In addition, it is revealed that such imperfect honeycombs can be regarded as isotropic.},

Elastic solutions are derived for both elastically anisotropic and isotropic thin films with arbitrary domain structures, subject to the mixed stress-free and constraint boundary conditions. These solutions are employed in a three-dimensional phase-field model to investigate simultaneously the effect of substrate constraint and temperature on the volume fractions of domain variants, domain-wall orientations, surface topology, domain shapes, and their temporal evolution for a cubic-to-tetragonal ferroelectric phase transition. A specific example of a [001] orientated film heteroepitaxially grown on a [001] cubic substrate is considered. It is shown that the shapes of a-domains with tetragonal axes parallel to the film surface are significantly different from those of c-domains with tetragonal axes perpendicular to the film surface. For the substrate constraints and temperatures under which both a- and c-domains coexist, both types of a-domains are present with their tetragonal axes perpendicular to each other, and the domain wall orientations deviate from the 45 orientation generally assumed in thermodynamic analyses. It is demonstrated that a substrate constraint results in sequential nucleation and growth of different tetragonal domains during a ferroelectric phase transition.},

We show that the results of such simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the standard PC1D one-dimensional photovoltaic simulation.

Our model provides complete spectral and spatial information of typical optical and electronic behavior. Furthermore, our approach permits the detailed investigation of complex systems, including plasmonic SCs, which cannot be simulated using low-dimensional modeling tools.

Conventionally, the band structures of 2D PCs were calculated by either the plane-wave expansion method (PWEM) or the finite difference time domain method. Here, we solve the eigenvalue equations for the band structures of the 2D PCs using the adaptive FEM in real space. We have carefully examined the convergence of this approach for the desired accuracy and efficiency. The calculated results show some discrepancies when compared to the results calculated by the PWEM. This may be due to the accuracy of the PWEM limited by the discontinuous nature of the dielectric functions. After acquiring the whole information of the dispersion relations within the irreducible Brillouin zone of the 2D PCs, the in-plane photon density of states for both the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes can be calculated, accurately. For the case, the width of the complete band gap predicted by the FEM is much smaller, only about 65 \% of that calculated by the PWEM. Therefore, the discrepancy in the prediction of complete band gaps between these two methods can be quite large, although the difference in band structure calculations is only a few percent. These results are relevant to the spontaneous emission by an atom, or to dipole radiation in two-dimensional periodic structures.},

They exhibit tunable single-band and dual-band resonances by changing height between inner and outer SRRs. The maximum tuning range of dual-band resonance is 0.55\,THz from the resonance of 0.45\,THz shifted to the resonance of 1.00\,THz. The corresponding tuning range of free spectrum range (FSR) spanned two resonances can be tuned from 0.20\,THz to 0.75\,THz. By changing radius of inner SRR from 14.5\,{$\mu$}m to 22.5\,{$\mu$}m, the tuning range of resonance is 0.40\,THz. While changing the height between inner and outer SRRs and kept the radiuses of inner and outer SRRs as constant as 22.5\,{$\mu$}m, 3D-DSRR can be tuned to have two resonances and then merge into one resonance. 3D-DSRR shows a tunable and switchable resonance for single-band and dual-band characteristics. These characterizations are very suitable for the use of tunable multi-resonance applications. To further investigate the stability of 3D-DSRR, the rotation angles of inner and outer SRRs are modified from 0\textdegree{} to 180\textdegree, respectively. The corresponding resonances are identical. Such results indicate the proposed device with high stability to allow manufacturing tolerance and potentially to be used in wearable electronic devices, pressure sensors, and other fields.},

The range of possible ferroelectric transition temperatures and the possible ferroelectric states of a strained SrTiO3 film are determined with respect to the variation in the reported properties of bulk SrTiO3 single crystals. The ferroelectric and structural domain morphologies at a biaxial tensile strain e0=0.94\% were predicted using phase-field simulations. It is shown that variations in the reported values of bulk properties and in the Landau energy coefficients from different literature sources lead not only to a wide range of possible transition temperatures at a given strain, but also to different ferroelectric states (e.g., polarization along the pseudocubic {$\langle$}110{$\rangle$} vs {$\langle$}100{$\rangle$} directions) thus different domain structures under a biaxial tensile strain. Both optical second harmonic generation and confocal scanning optical microscopy measurements demonstrate that the domain states in SrTiO3 films strained at e0=0.94\% and 1.16\% exhibit polar directions along the pseudocubic {$\langle$}110{$\rangle$} directions within the pseudocubic (001) plane of the film.}

Considering manufacturing process constraints in topology optimization becomes increasingly important due to its potential practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel topology optimization model with manufacturing process related connectivity constraints. A generalized method, named as virtual scalar field method (VSFM), is developed for describing and enforcing desired connectivity constraint. As an illustrative example, the connectivity constraint can be converted to an equivalent maximum temperature constraint when temperature is chosen as the scalar field. The temperature constraint is then easily integrated and implemented in routine topology optimization. The simply-connected constraint, which excludes interior closed cavities and is representative of many advanced manufacturing techniques, e.g. additive manufacturing (AM) or casting, is used as an example to demonstrate the key ideas and the efficiency of the VSF method. Some numerical examples, which consider the connectivity constraint in topology optimization, are presented to show the validity of this method.},

Here, we report all-solid-phase reconfigurable chiral nanostructures with silicon nanoparticles and nanowires as the building blocks in which the configuration and chiroptical response can be tailored on-demand by dynamic manipulation of the silicon nanoparticle. We reveal that the optical chirality originates from the handedness-dependent coupling between optical resonances of the silicon nanoparticle and the silicon nanowire via numerical simulations and coupled-mode theory analysis. Furthermore, the coexisting electric and magnetic resonances support strong enhancement of optical near-field chirality, which enables label-free enantiodiscrimination of biomolecules in single nanostructures.

To match the complex spatial distribution of the required constitutive parameters, we constructed a metamaterial consisting of thousands of elements, the geometry of each element determined by an automated design process. The ground-plane cloak can be realized with the use of nonresonant metamaterial elements, resulting in a structure having a broad operational bandwidth (covering the range of 13 to 16 gigahertz in our experiment) and exhibiting extremely low loss.

However, due to the high computational cost of the EM simulations, the efficiency of directly using evolutionary algorithms is often very low (e.g., several weeks' optimization time), which limits the application of these methods for many industrial applications. To address this problem, a new method, called surrogate model assisted differential evolution for antenna synthesis (SADEA), is presented in this paper. The key ideas are: (1) A Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model is constructed on-line to predict the performances of the candidate designs, saving a lot of computationally expensive EM simulations. (2) A novel surrogate model-aware evolutionary search mechanism is proposed, directing effective global search even when a traditional high-quality surrogate model is not available. Three complex antennas and two mathematical benchmark problems are selected as examples. Compared with the widely used differential evolution and particle swarm optimization, SADEA can obtain comparable results, but achieves a 3 to 7 times speed enhancement for antenna design optimization.},

Appl. 8, 054049 (2017)] thin films only observed weak dependence of thermal conductivity k on an electric field. In order to explain the experimental results and theoretically explore the electric field-controlled thermal switch, we solve the linearized Boltzmann transport equation with first-principles force constants to calculate k of PbTiO3 at different electric fields. For a single-domain structure, the k variation under an electric field is caused by the intrinsic structural response, whose main effects are manifested through the phonon-phonon scattering. The k accumulation function indicates that in order to observe the intrinsic electric field (E) effects, the domain size d should be larger than the critical domain size (CDS), around 30 nm at 300 K and 150 nm at 80 K. Introducing domain wall (DW) scattering creates an additional, extrinsic mechanism for k control: the effects of an E on d can either increase or decrease the k variation, and the k(T) function generally exhibits a peak at some temperature T {$<$} 300 K due to the competition between phonon-phonon scattering and DW scattering. This study identifies three strategies to maximize the k variation in response to an E: using samples with d larger than the CDS, maximizing the sensitivity of d to an E, and decreasing T to an optimum.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of characterizing the set of the effective tensors of multi-phase composites, including those of conductive materials and elastic materials. We first present a novel derivation of the Hashin\textendash Shtrikman (HS) bounds for multi-phase composites and the associated attainment condition. The attainment condition asserts that the HS bound is attainable if, and only if, there exists a second gradient field that is constant in all but the matrix phases. By restricting and constructing such second gradient fields, we obtain a series of sufficient conditions such that the HS bounds are attainable or unattainable. These attainability and unattainability results appear new for a generic situation. For special situations, our attainability and unattainability results recover the results of Milton (1981 Phys. Rev. Lett.46, 542\textendash 545), Sigmund (2000 J.~Mech. Phys. Solids48, 397\textendash 428), Gibiansky \& Sigmund (2000 J. Mech. Phys. Solids48, 461\textendash 498) and Albin et al. (2007aJ. Mech.

  abstract = {Data driven materials discovery and optimization requires databases that are error free and experimentally verified. Performing material measurements are time-consuming and often restricted by the fact that material sample preparations are non-trivial, labour-intensive and expensive. Numerical modelling of materials has been studied over the years in order to address these issues and nowadays it has been developed at multi-scale and multi-physics levels. However, numerical models for nano-composites, especially for ferroelectrics are limited due to multiple unknowns including oxygen vacancy densities, grain sizes and domain boundaries existing in the system. In this work, we introduce a human-machine interactive learning framework by developing a scalable semi-empirical model to accurately predict material properties enabled by deep learning (DL). MgO-doped BST (BaxSr1-xTiO3) is selected as an example ferroelectric-dielectric composite for validation. The DL model transfer-learns the experimental features of materials from a measurement database which includes data for over 100 different ferroelectric composites collected by screening the published data and combining our own measurement data. The trained DL model is utilized in providing feedback to human researchers, who then refine computer model parameters accordingly, hence completing the interactive learning cycle. Finally, the developed DL model is applied to predict and optimise new ferroelectric-dielectric composites with the highest figure of merit (FOM) value.},

To elucidate the impurity effect, purified GNP dispersions are obtained through an ultrasonic-aided method. The result reveals a small bulk temperature increase, i.e., less than one centigrade for impurified samples, and even smaller for purified samples, which contrasts significantly to some earlier publications. The measured dielectric properties of GNP dispersions show a negligible change in the effective conductivities for purified samples, which indicates that the dielectric loss alone does not predict substantial temperature increase of GNPs. Further discussion shows that none of the established theories supports the idea that GNPs can dissipate RF energy significantly.},

As two special cases, the Euler\textendash Bernoulli and Rayleigh beam theories can be analytically reduced from the Timoshenko beam theory. All material properties are arbitrary functions along the beam thickness. A single fourth-order governing partial differential equation is derived and all physical quantities can be expressed in terms of the solution of the resulting equation. The static result of deflection and stress distribution is presented for a cantilever FGB. Furthermore, two branches of flexural waves propagating in FGB are obtained with different wave speeds. The higher wave speed disappears when the effects of neither the rotary inertia nor shear deformation are considered. Free vibration of an FGB is analyzed and the frequency equation is given. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of a simply supported beam are obtained for frequencies lower than, equal to and higher than the cut-off frequency. Numerical results are presented for an FGB with the power-law gradient and a laminated beam. The second frequency spectrum is found to exist when frequencies exceed the cut-off frequency. In addition, double frequencies may occur for certain specified geometry of the beam. Previous results for a homogeneous Timoshenko beam can be recovered from the present only letting the material properties be constant. The suggested method is also applicable to layered Timoshenko beams.},

It addresses the sustainability issue in product family design, which means an end-of-life (EoL) product can be remanufactured through subtractive machining into another lower-level model within the product family. In this way, the EoL product is recycled in an environmental-friendly and energy-saving manner. Technically, a sustainability constraint is proposed that the different product models employ the containment relationship, which is a necessary condition for the subtractive remanufacturing. A novel level set-based product family representation is proposed to realize the containment relationship, and the related topology optimization problem is formulated and solved. In addition, spatial arrangement of the input design domains is explored to prevent highly stressed material regions from reusing. Feature-based level set concept for sustainability is then used. The novelty of the proposed method is that, for the first time, the product lifecycle issue of sustainability is addressed by a topology optimization method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved through a few numerical examples.}

THz peak transmission as a function of bias shows a similar tendency as the current-voltage response of the heterojunction: the forward bias leads to the exponential enhancement of THz transmission, and in contrast, the reverse bias shows no observable changes in THz transmission. The modulation depth and modulation bandwidth of THz pulse can reach up to 42\% and 1.0 THz with forward bias of 4.8 V, respectively. The observed bias dependent THz transmission in the BFO/Si heterojunction is well-interpreted by the proposed model: the diffused carriers across the heterojunction are localized in BFO thin film with applied forward bias.

To demonstrate the proposed solution, a 2 \texttimes 2 slot array antenna, which is considered as a test case, is designed and fabricated. By placing the HM atop of the radiation ground of the slot array antenna, radar cross section reduction (RCSR) is dramatically accomplished over a frequency band ranging from 5 to 25 GHz.

It is demonstrated that Fabry\textendash Perot (or cavity) resonances are generated by the zeroth slit mode yielding extraordinary transmission. For very narrow slits, the resonant H-field is squeezed to the slit walls and causes enhanced power losses. The excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), however, is generated by two mode coupling. SPPs are linked to sharp absorption peaks and dips in transmittance. It is shown that these phenomena are primarily caused by the interaction of the electromagnetic fields with the finite conducting slit walls. These findings have been confirmed by measured transmittance data of gold gratings with periods of 0.5 {$\mu$}m, 1 {$\mu$}m, and 2 {$\mu$}m.},

  abstract = {The photonics topological state plays an important role in recent optical physics and has led to devices with robust properties. However, the design of optical structures with the target topological states is a challenge for current research. Here, we propose an approach to achieve this goal by exploiting machine learning technologies. In our work, we focus on Zak phases, which are the topological properties of one-dimensional photonics crystals. After learning the principle between the geometrical parameters and the Zak phases, the neural network can obtain the appropriate structures of photonics crystals by applying the objective Zak phase properties. Our work would give more insights into the application of machine learning on the inverse design of the complex material properties and could be extended to other fields, i.e., advanced phononics devices.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to remove the supports in an enclosed void of an additively manufactured structure, while it is much easier in open regions. This paper presents a novel approach to control the minimal overhang angle only in enclosed voids in order to improve the manufacturability of AM structures with as little performance loss as possible. Firstly, a nonlinear virtual temperature method (N-VTM) is proposed to identify the enclosed voids. In the N-VTM method, void areas are assumed to be filled with a temperature-dependent heating material with high heat conductivity while the solid parts have low heat conductivity. Due to a nonlinear heat source term, the maximum temperature is controlled to a prescribed value, making the temperature in enclosed voids uniform over the whole structures. Hence, the enclosed voids can be easily identified without a careful selection of parameters. Then, the gradient of the filtered density field is applied to evaluate the overhang angle of the interface. Finally, a multiple filtering/projection process is developed to identify the overhang interface of enclosed voids, and then a logarithmic function-based constraint is developed to control overhang angle in enclosed voids by restricting the area of overhang interface of enclosed voids. Enhanced by the robust formulation, a topology optimization method for the design of structures with self-supported enclosed voids is then established. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This problem has so far been attributed to the imperfect conditioning of the matrices to be diagonalized. The present analysis based on a modal vision reveals that the so-called instabilities are true features of the solution of the mathematical problem of a binary metal grating dealt with by truncated Fourier representation of Maxwell's equations. The extreme sensitivity of this solution to the optogeometrical parameters is the result of the excitation, propagation, coupling, interference, and resonance of a finite number of very slow propagating spurious modes. An astute management of these modes permits a complete and safe removal of the numerical instabilities at the price of an arbitrarily small and controllable reduction in accuracy as compared with the referenced true-mode method.},

In 2D ultra-thin plasmonic structures the circular dichroism is limited to 25\&\#x00025; in theory and it requires high absorption loss. Here we propose and numerically demonstrate a planar chiral all-dielectric metasurface that exhibits giant circular dichroism and transmission asymmetry over 0.8 for circularly polarized lights with negligible loss, without bringing in bianisotropy or violating reciprocity. The metasurface consists of arrays of high refractive index germanium Z-shape resonators that break the in-plane mirror symmetry and induce cross-polarization conversion. Furthermore, at the transmission peak of one handedness, the transmitted light is efficiently converted into the opposite circular polarization state, with a designated geometric phase depending on the orientation angle of the optical element. In this way, the optical component sets before and after the metasurface to filter the light of certain circular polarization states are not needed and the metasurface can function under any linear polarization, in contrast to the conventional setup for geometry phase based metasurfaces. Anomalous transmission and two-dimensional holography based on the geometric phase chiral metasurface are numerically demonstrate as proofs of concept.},

The structure is homogeneous in two dimensions but the properties might vary through the thickness. This wave/finite element (WFE) method involves post-processing the mass and stiffness matrices, found using conventional FE methods, of a segment of the structure. This is typically a 4-noded, rectangular segment, although other elements can be used. Periodicity conditions are applied to relate the nodal degrees of freedom and forces. The wavenumbers\textemdash real, imaginary or complex\textemdash and the frequencies then follow from various resulting eigenproblems. The form of the eigenproblem depends on the nature of the solution sought and may be a linear, quadratic, polynomial or transcendental eigenproblem. Numerical issues are discussed. Examples of a thin plate, an asymmetric laminated plate and a laminated foam-cored sandwich panel are presented. For the last two examples, developing an analytical model is a formidable task at best. The method is seen to give accurate predictions at very little computational cost. Furthermore, since the element matrices are typically found using a commercial FE package, the meshing capabilities and the wealth of existing element libraries can be exploited.},

Here, we report a deep-learning-based model, comprising two bidirectional neural networks assembled by a partial stacking strategy, to automatically design and optimize three-dimensional chiral metamaterials with strong chiroptical responses at predesignated wavelengths. The model can help to discover the intricate, nonintuitive relationship between a metamaterial structure and its optical responses from a number of training examples, which circumvents the timeconsuming, case-by-case numerical simulations in conventional metamaterial designs. This approach not only realizes the forward prediction of optical performance much more accurately and efficiently but also enables one to inversely retrieve designs from given requirements. Our results demonstrate that such a data-driven model can be applied as a very powerful tool in studying complicated light-matter interactions and accelerating the on-demand design of nanophotonic devices, systems, and architectures for real world applications.},

The resulting equations include tensors that represent effective refractive indices near band edge frequencies along all principal axes directions, and these govern scalar functions providing long-scale modulation of short-scale Bloch eigenstates, which can be used to predict the propagation of waves at frequencies outside of the long wavelength regime; these results are outside of the remit of typical homogenisation schemes. The theory we develop is applied to two topical examples, the first being the case of aligned dielectric cylinders, which has great importance in modelling photonic crystal fibres. Results of the asymptotic theory are verified against numerical simulations by comparing photonic band diagrams and evanescent decay rates for guided modes. The second example is the propagation of electromagnetic waves localised within a planar array of dielectric spheres; at certain frequencies strongly directional propagation is observed, commonly described as dynamic anisotropy. Computationally this is a challenging three-dimensional calculation, which we perform, and then demonstrate that the asymptotic theory captures the effect, giving highly accurate qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as providing interpretation for the underlying change from elliptic to hyperbolic behaviour.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the anisotropic molecular shape and tunable alignment of liquid crystals (LCs), investigations on hybrid nanodevices which combine LCs with plasmonic metasurfaces have received great attention recently. Since LCs possess unique electro-optical properties, developing novel dynamic optical components by incorporating nematic LCs with nanostructures offers a variety of practical applications. Owing to the large birefringence of LCs, the optical properties of metamaterials can be electrically or optically modulated over a wide range. In this review article, we show different elegant designs of metasurface based nanodevices integrated into LCs and explore the tuning factors of transmittance/extinction/scattering spectra. Moreover, we review and classify substantial tunable devices enabled by LC-plasmonic interactions. These dynamically tunable optoelectronic nanodevices and components are of extreme importance, since they can enable a significant range of applications, including ultra-fast switching, modulating, sensing, imaging, and waveguiding. By integrating LCs with two dimensional metasurfaces, one can manipulate electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale with dramatically reduced sizes. Owing to their special electro-optical properties, recent efforts have demonstrated that more accurate manipulation of LC-displays can be engineered by precisely controlling the alignment of LCs inside small channels. In particular, device performance can be significantly improved by optimizing geometries and the surrounding environmental parameters.},

  abstract = {Recently, disordered photonic media and random textured surfaces have attracted increasing attention as strong light diffusers with broadband and wide-angle properties. We report the experimental realization of an isotropic complete photonic band gap (PBG) in a 2D disordered dielectric structure. This structure is designed by a constrained optimization method, which combines advantages of both isotropy due to disorder and controlled scattering properties due to low-density fluctuations (hyperuniformity) and uniform local topology. Our experiments use a modular design composed of Al2O3 walls and cylinders arranged in a hyperuniform disordered network. We observe a complete PBG in the microwave region, in good agreement with theoretical simulations, and show that the intrinsic isotropy of this unique class of PBG materials enables remarkable design freedom, including the realization of waveguides with arbitrary bending angles impossible in photonic crystals. This experimental verification of a complete PBG and realization of functional defects in this unique class of materials demonstrate their potential as building blocks for precise manipulation of photons in planar optical microcircuits and has implications for disordered acoustic and electronic band gap materials.},

  abstract = {A broad range of dynamic metasurfaces has been developed for manipulating the intensity, phase and wavefront of electromagnetic radiation from microwaves to optical frequencies. However, most of these metasurfaces operate in single-input\textendash output state. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable MEMS Fano resonant metasurface possessing multiple-input\textendash output (MIO) states that performs logic operations with two independently controlled electrical inputs and an optical readout at terahertz frequencies. The far-field behaviour of Fano resonance exhibits XOR and XNOR operations, while the near-field resonant confinement enables the NAND operation. The MIO configuration resembling hysteresis-type closed-loop behaviour is realized through inducing electromechanically tuneable out-of-plane anisotropy in the near-field coupling of constituent resonator structures. The XOR metamaterial gate possesses potential applications in cryptographically secured terahertz wireless communication networks. Furthermore, the MIO features could lay the foundation for the realization of programmable and randomly accessible metamaterials with enhanced electro-optical performance across terahertz, infrared and optical frequencies.},

In this work, we achieve slow light in topologically unidirectional waveguides based on periodically loading an edge termination with suitably tailored resonances.

We establish the connection between MDOS, LDOS, SDOS and the conventional density of states, which depends only on frequency. We relate all four functions to the band structure and propagating states within the crystal, and give numerical examples of the relation between band structure and density of states functions.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the polarization characteristics is a prevailing issue in electrostatics and scattering theory and is also vital to the rational design of future dielectric nanostructures. In this work, a finite-element methodology has been applied to simulate two-phase heterostructures containing a polarizable dielectric inclusion. The inclusions investigated can be considered as arbitrarily shaped cross sections of infinite three-dimensional objects, where the properties and characteristics are invariant along the perpendicular cross-sectional plane. Given the paucity of experimental and numerical data, we set out to systematically investigate the trends that shape and permittivity contrast between the inclusion and the host matrix have on the depolarization factor (DF). The effect of the first\textendash versus second-order concentration virial coefficient on the value of the DF is considered for a variety of inclusion shapes and a large set of material properties. Our findings suggest that the DF for such inclusions is highly tunable depending on the choice of these parameters. These results can provide a useful insight for the design of artificial two-phase heterostructures with specific polarization properties.},

For this, nanophotonic elements in the wave-optics regime are highly promising, as they capture and trap light in the cells' absorber, enabling its thickness reduction while improving its efficiency. Here, novel wavelength-sized photonic structures were computationally optimized toward maximum broadband light absorption. Thin-film silicon cells were the test bed to determine the best performing parameters and study their optical effects. Pronounced photocurrent enhancements, up to 37\%, 27\%, and 48\%, respectively, in ultra-thin (100-~and 300-nm-thick) amorphous, and thin (1.5-{$\mu$}m) crystalline silicon cells are demonstrated with honeycomb arrays of semi-spheroidal dome or void-like elements patterned on the cells' front. Also importantly, key advantages in the electrical performance are anticipated, since the photonic nano/micro-nanostructures do not increase the cell roughness, therefore not contributing to recombination, which is a crucial drawback in state-of-the-art light-trapping approaches.},

Even without imposing the constraints of any fabrication process, the resulting optimal gaps are only slightly larger than previous hand designs, suggesting that current photonic crystals are nearly optimal in this respect. However, optimization can discover new structures, e.g. a new fcc structure with the same symmetry but slightly larger gap than the well known inverse opal, which may offer new degrees of freedom to future fabrication technologies. Furthermore, our band-gap optimization is an illustration of a computational approach to 3D dispersion engineering which is applicable to many other problems in optics, based on a novel semidefinite-program formulation for nonconvex eigenvalue optimization combined with other techniques such as a simple approach to impose symmetry constraints. We also demonstrate a technique for robust topology optimization, in which some uncertainty is included in each voxel and we optimize the worst-case gap, and we show that the resulting band gaps have increased robustness to systematic fabrication errors.},

For these cavities, the current best optimal designs still result in Q-values of a few times 105 only, namely one order of magnitude below the bound set by fabrication imperfections and material absorption in silicon. Here, we use a genetic algorithm to find a global maximum of the quality factor of these designs, by varying the positions of few neighbouring holes.

The adjoint variable method, which allows for the efficient computation of gradients, has played a major role in this success. However, gradient-based optimization has not yet been applied to the mode-expansion methods that are the most common approaches to studying periodic optical structures such as photonic crystals. This is because, in such simulations, the adjoint variable method cannot be defined as explicitly as in standard finite-difference or finite-element time- or frequency-domain methods. Here, we overcome this gap through the use of automatic differentiation, which is a generalization of the adjoint variable method to arbitrary computational graphs. We implement the plane-wave expansion and the guided-mode expansion methods using an automatic differentiation library, and we show that the gradient of any simulation output can be computed efficiently and in parallel, with respect to all input parameters. We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a photonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultrasmall cavity in a lithium niobate slab. This extends photonic inverse design to an entirely new class of simulations, and more broadly highlights the importance that automatic differentiation could play in the future for tracking and optimizing complicated physical models.},

A promising way that this can be achieved in all-dielectric photonic crystals is through the design of a Dirac cone at zero Bloch wave vector in the photonic band structure. In the optical frequency range, the natural way to implement this design is through the use of a photonic crystal slab. In the existing implementation, however, the zero-index photonic modes also radiate strongly into the environment due to intrinsic symmetry properties. This has resulted in large losses in recent experimental realizations of this zero-index paradigm. Here, we propose a photonic crystal slab with zero-index modes which are also symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum. Our approach thus eliminates the associated radiation loss. This could enable, for the first time, large-scale integration of zero-index materials in photonic devices.},

To test the analysis, phase constants, characteristic impedances, and attenuations, due to dielectric losses, were computed for microstrip and coupled microstrip lines. The results obtained were compared with those given previously by the spectral domain analysis in which dielectric losses were not included directly [1].

The computations are based on a discontinuous Galerkin time-domain approach, and a fully nonlinear and nonlocal hydrodynamic Drude model for the metal is utilized. In the linear regime, these computations demonstrate the strong influence of nonlocality on the field distributions as well as on the scattering and absorption spectra. Based on these results, second-harmonic-generation efficiencies are computed over a frequency range that covers all relevant modes of the linear spectra. In order to interpret the physical mechanisms that lead to corresponding field distributions, the associated linear quasielectrostatic problem is solved analytically via conformal transformation techniques. This provides an intuitive classification of the linear excitations of the systems that is then applied to the full Maxwell case. Based on this classification, group theory facilitates the determination of the selection rules for the efficient excitation of modes in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. This leads to significantly enhanced second-harmonic generation via judiciously exploiting the system symmetries. These results regarding the mode structure and second-harmonic generation are of direct relevance to other nanoantenna systems.},

We show that perfect boundary conditions are not an optimal solution, since they depend on the incident waves. The full analytical form of PMLs and zero reflection conditions at the boundary between homogeneous and PML domains are given. The implementation in a Finite Element (FEM) code is described and an eigenfrequency analysis is given as a possible methodology to check the implementation itself. A measure of the performances of the PMLs is introduced and the effects of element discretization, boundary conditions, frequency, dimension of the PML, amount of transformation and dissipation are detailed.

  abstract = {The challenge of designing new solid-state materials from calculations performed with the help of computers applied to models of spatial randomness has attracted an increasing amount of interest in recent years. In particular, dispersions of particles in a host matrix are scientifically and technologically important for a variety of reasons. Herein, we report our development of an efficient computer code to calculate the effective (bulk) permittivity of two-phase disordered composite media consisting of hard circular disks made of a lossless dielectric (permittivity {$\epsilon$}2) randomly placed in a plane made of a lossless homogeneous dielectric (permittivity {$\epsilon$}1) at different surface fractions. Specifically, the method is based on (i) a finite-element description of composites in which both the host and the randomly distributed inclusions are isotropic phases, and (ii) an ordinary Monte Carlo sampling. Periodic boundary conditions are employed throughout the simulation and various numbers of disks have been considered in the calculations. From this systematic study, we show how the number of Monte Carlo steps needed to achieve equilibrated distributions of disks increases monotonically with the surface fraction. Furthermore, a detailed study is made of the dependence of the results on a minimum separation distance between disks. Numerical examples are presented to connect the macroscopic property such as the effective permittivity to microstructural characteristics such as the mean coordination number and radial distribution function. In addition, several approximate effective medium theories, exact bounds, exact results for two-dimensional regular arrays, and the exact dilute limit are used to test and validate the finite-element algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the fourth-order bounds provide an excellent estimate of the effective permittivity for a wide range of surface fractions, in accordance with the fact that the bounds become progressively narrower as more microstructural information is incorporated. Future directions of the active field of computational studies of the structure-property relations for composite systems are briefly discussed.},

We further develop a novel method to solve the inverse modeling problem, termed fast forward dictionary search (FFDS), which offers tremendous controls to the designer and only requires an accurate forward neural network model.

Since those experiments are often expensive, it is important to develop techniques for finding a solution with as less number of experiments as possible. To this end, the model predictive optimization methods aim to find an optimal solution in parallel with predicting the function forms in mathematical models. Successive approximate optimization or metamodeling are of the same terminology. So far, several kinds of methods have been developed for this purpose. Among them, response surface method, design of experiments, Kriging method, active learning methods and methods using computational intelligence are well known. However, the subject of those methods is mainly static optimization. For dynamic optimization problems, the model predictive control has been developed along a similar idea to the above.

To do this, coordinate-ladder operators are defined from mode-ladder operators via the unitary transformation of systems involved in arbitrary inhomogeneous dielectric media. Then, one can expand electromagnetic field operators through the coordinate-ladder operators weighted by non-orthogonal and spatially-localized bases, which are propagators of initial quantum electromagnetic (complex-valued) field operators. Here, we call them QEM-CV-propagators. However, there are no general closed form solutions available for them. This inspires us to develop a quantum finite-difference time-domain (Q-FDTD) scheme to numerically time evolve QEM-CV-propagators. In order to check the validity of the proposed Q-FDTD scheme, we perform computer simulations to observe the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect resulting from the destructive interference of two photons in a 50/50 quantum beam splitter.},

  abstract = {We present a computational framework for canonical quantization in arbitrary inhomogeneous dielectric media by incorporating quantum electromagnetic effects into complex solutions of quantum Maxwell's equations. To do so, the proposed algorithm integrates and performs (1) numerical computation of normal modes and (2) evaluation of arbitrary products of ladder operators acting on multimode Fock states. The former is associated with Hermitian-Helmholtz linear systems using finite-element or finite-difference methods; consequently, the complete set of numerical normal modes diagonalizes the Hamiltonian operators up to floating-point precision. Its Hermiticity is retained, allowing its quantization. Then, we perform quantum numerical simulations of two-photon interference occurring in a 50:50 beam splitter to observe the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. Our prototype model is useful for numerical analyses on various narrow-band quantum-optical multiphoton systems such as quantum metasurfaces, quantum-optical filters, and quantum electrodynamics in open optical cavities.},

  abstract = {The law of reciprocity in acoustics and elastodynamics codifies a relation of symmetry between action and reaction in fluids and solids. In its simplest form, it states that the frequency-response functions between any two material points remain the same after swapping source and receiver, regardless of the presence of inhomogeneities and losses. As such, reciprocity has enabled numerous applications that make use of acoustic and elastic wave propagation. A recent change in paradigm has prompted us to see reciprocity under a new light: as an obstruction to the realization of wave-bearing media in which the source and receiver are not interchangeable. Such materials may enable the creation of devices such as acoustic one-way mirrors, isolators and topological insulators. Here, we review how reciprocity breaks down in materials with momentum bias, structured space-dependent and time-dependent constitutive properties, and constitutive nonlinearity, and report on recent advances in the modelling and fabrication of these materials, as well as on experiments demonstrating nonreciprocal acoustic and elastic wave propagation therein. The success of these efforts holds promise to enable robust, unidirectional acoustic and elastic wave-steering capabilities that exceed what is currently possible in conventional materials, metamaterials or phononic crystals.},

First proposed in the 1980s as a way to improve computational modeling of quantum systems, the field of quantum computing has recently garnered significant attention due to progress in building small-scale devices. However, significant technical advances will be required before a large-scale, practical quantum computer can be achieved. Quantum Computing: Progress and Prospects provides an introduction to the field, including the unique characteristics and constraints of the technology, and assesses the feasibility and implications of creating a functional quantum computer capable of addressing real-world problems. This report considers hardware and software requirements, quantum algorithms, drivers of advances in quantum computing and quantum devices, benchmarks associated with relevant use cases, the time and resources required, and how to assess the probability of success.},

Structural, morphological, optical, and terahertz characterization of the BST films were performed by X-ray Diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy, Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE), and Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Single-phase samples with strong preferred (1\,1\,1) orientation and surface roughness lower than 1.5\% of their thicknesses have been obtained for both types of substrates. SE was employed to extract the thickness and optical properties by using a 3-layer optical model (substrate/thin film/roughness). The inferred refractive index @630\,nm is around 2.05, while the optical interference is visible until 3.3\,eV. The THz-TDS measurements in transmission set-up were carried out one after the other on substrates before and after the BST film deposition. The standard THz-TDS analysis of double-layer samples proved difficult to complete in the cases in which a thin or thick film is deposited on a much thicker substrate of known dielectric properties. However, we have been able to extract the complex dielectric permittivity in the THz domain for BST samples with thicknesses of few microns, by developing a specific procedure of data analysis.},

The waveguides are first calibrated at the reference planes by the TRL calibration. Then, the scattering parameters in the presence of MUT specimen are measured at two SMA ports of the waveguides by an Agilent VNA. These coefficients are de-embedded to the reference planes by the TRL calibration. Finally, the Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) algorithm is used to extract the dielectric constant and the loss tangent of the MUT. The simulation and measurement are performed at the 1.7-2.7 GHz band. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel methodology for the optimisation of resonant frequencies in three-dimensional lattice structures. The method uses a multiscale approach in which the homogenised material properties of the lattice unit cell are defined by the spatially varying lattice parameters. Material properties derived from precomputed simulations of the small scale lattice are projected onto response surfaces, thereby describing the large-scale metamaterial properties as polynomial functions of the small-scale parameters. Resonant frequencies and mode shapes are obtained through the eigenvalue analysis of the large-scale finite element model which provides the basis for deriving the frequency sensitivities. Frequency tailoring is achieved by imposing constraints on the resonant frequency for a compliance minimisation optimisation. A sorting method based on the Modal Assurance Criterion allows for specific mode shapes to be optimised whilst simultaneously reducing the impact of localised modes on the optimisation. Three cases of frequency constraints are investigated and compared with an unconstrained optimisation to demonstrate the algorithms applicability. The results show that the optimisation is capable of handling strict frequency constraints and with the use of the modal tracking can even alter the original ordering of the resonant mode shapes. Frequency tailoring allows for improved functionality of compliance-minimised aerospace components by avoiding resonant frequencies and hence dynamic stresses.},

  abstract = {Significance: Terahertz (THz) radiation has demonstrated a great potential in biomedical applications over the past three decades, mainly due to its non-invasive and label-free nature. Among all biological specimens, skin tissue is an optimal sample for the application of THz-based methods because it allows for overcoming some intrinsic limitations of the technique, such as a small penetration depth (0.1 to 0.3 mm for the skin, on average). Aim: We summarize the modern research results achieved when THz technology was applied to the skin, considering applications in both imaging/detection and treatment/modulation of the skin constituents. Approach: We perform a review of literature and analyze the recent research achievements in THz applications for skin diagnosis and investigation. Results: The reviewed results demonstrate the possibilities of THz spectroscopy and imaging, both pulsed and continuous, for diagnosis of skin melanoma and non-melanoma cancer, dysplasia, scars, and diabetic condition, mainly based on the analysis of THz optical properties. The possibility of modulating cell activity and treatment of various diseases by THz-wave exposure is shown as well. Conclusions: The rapid development of THz technologies and the obtained research results for skin tissue highlight the potential of THz waves as a research and therapeutic instrument. The perspectives on the use of THz radiation are related to both non-invasive diagnostics and stimulation and control of different processes in a living skin tissue for regeneration and cancer treatment.},

We present the first quantitative analysis of the frequency resolution and of the accuracy of the calculated LDOS. We have calculated the projected LDOS for many different emitter positions and orientations in inverse opals in order to supply a theoretical interpretation for recent emission experiments and as reference results for future experiments and theory by other workers. The results show that the LDOS in inverse opals strongly depends on the crystal lattice parameter as well as on the position and orientation of emitting dipoles.},

B-spline basis functions are employed for the IGA discretization procedure to improve the performance of electromagnetic wave analysis in a unit cell and topology optimization.

Here, we review the foundation and the state-of-the-art advances of topological photonics, acoustics and mechanical MMs. We discuss how topological MMs enable nontrivial wave phenomena in physics, engineering, of great interest for a broad range of interdisciplinary science disciplines such as classical and quantum chemistry. We first introduce the foundations of topological materials and the main concepts behind their peculiar features, including the concepts of topological charge and geometric phase. We then discuss the topology of electronic band structures in natural topological materials, like topological insulators and gapless Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Based on these concepts, we review the concept, design and response of topologically nontrivial MMs in photonics and phononics, including topological phases in 2D MMs with and without time-reversal symmetry, Floquet TIs based on spatial and temporal modulation, topological phases in 3D MMs, higher-order topological phases in MMs, non-Hermitian and nonlinear topological MMs and the topological features of scattering anomalies. We also discuss the topological properties emerging in other related contexts, such as the topological aspects of chemical reactions and polaritons. This survey aims at connecting the recent advances in a broad range of scientific areas associated with topological concepts, and highlights opportunities offered by topological MMs for the chemistry community at large.},

Most cloaks developed so far have bulky structures that are difficult to scale up for hiding large objects. To design a thin invisibility cloak that can be wrapped around an object such as a sheet or skin, Ni et al. designed a two-dimensional metamaterial surface. Such flexible, highly reflective materials could be manufactured at large scale to hide large objects. Science, this issue p. 1310 Metamaterial-based optical cloaks have thus far used volumetric distribution of the material properties to gradually bend light and thereby obscure the cloaked region. Hence, they are bulky and hard to scale up and, more critically, typical carpet cloaks introduce unnecessary phase shifts in the reflected light, making the cloaks detectable. Here, we demonstrate experimentally an ultrathin invisibility skin cloak wrapped over an object. This skin cloak conceals a three-dimensional arbitrarily shaped object by complete restoration of the phase of the reflected light at 730-nanometer wavelength. The skin cloak comprises a metasurface with distributed phase shifts rerouting light and rendering the object invisible. In contrast to bulky cloaks with volumetric index variation, our device is only 80 nanometer (about one-ninth of the wavelength) thick and potentially scalable for hiding macroscopic objects. A metamaterial surface can be designed to operate as an invisibility skin cloak. A metamaterial surface can be designed to operate as an invisibility skin cloak.},

To determine the optimal material distributions of a piezoelectric material considering the harmonic dynamic coupling effects between the electric energy and a structure for efficient EHDs, harmonic dynamic responses and the complex sensitivity analyses for various objectives related to the energy efficiency are calculated and derived. For the relaxation method of the density design variable for TO, material properties such as the anisotropic linear elasticity coefficients, piezoelectric coefficients, and permittivity coefficients are independently interpolated through the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach with three penalization values. Through several numerical tests for various configurations of piezoelectric materials, it is found that depending on the choice of penalization value, complex behaviors of energies are possible and these in turn lead to a serious local optima issue in TO. Through several three-dimensional design problems, the validity and usefulness of the developed optimization procedure for efficient EHDs are demonstrated.},

We are particularly interested in the development of continuum models, valid at high frequencies, when the wavelength and each cell of the net are of similar order. Net structures are chosen as these form a general two-dimensional example, encapsulating the essential physics involved in the two-dimensional excitation of a lattice structure whilst retaining the simplicity of dealing with elastic strings. Homogenization techniques are developed here for wavelengths commensurate with the cellular scale. Unlike previous theories, these techniques are not limited to low frequency or static regimes, and lead to effective continuum equations valid on a macroscale with the details of the cellular structure encapsulated only through integrated quantities. The asymptotic procedure is based upon a two-scale approach and the physical observation that there are frequencies that give standing waves, periodic with the period or double-period of the cell. A specific example of a net created by a lattice of elastic strings is constructed, the theory is general and not reliant upon the net being infinite, none the less the infinite net is a useful special case for which Bloch theory can be applied. This special case is explored in detail allowing for verification of the theory, and highlights the importance of degenerate cases; the specific example of a square net is treated in detail. An additional illustration of the versatility of the method is the response to point forcing which provides a stringent test of the homogenized equations; an exact Green's function for the net is deduced and compared to the asymptotics.},

First, a way to apply topology optimization to the design of electromagnetic structures is briefly discussed. Next, the design specifications are clarified, and a new objective function is proposed to satisfy these specification. The optimization algorithm is developed using sequential linear programming (SLP) and the adjoint variable method (AVM).

A straightforward filtering technique projects the design geometry onto a fictitious analysis domain to support simplified response and sensitivity analysis. However, the analytical geometry model is referenced directly for all purely geometric calculations. The method thus combines the advantages of direct geometry representations with the simplified analysis procedures that are possible with fictitious domain analysis methods, such as the material distribution methods commonly used in topology optimization. The projected geometry measure converges to the indicator function of the analytical geometry model in the limit of numerical mesh refinement. Consequently, optimal designs obtained with the new method converge to solutions of well-defined continuum optimization problems in the limit of mesh refinement. This property is confirmed in example computations for minimum compliance design of an elastic structure subject to a volume constraint and for minimum volume design subject to a maximum stress constraint.

In this context a new class, Shrinkage EDAs, based on shrinkage estimation is presented. Also, a novelmutation operator based on a regularization of the entropy is discussed. Another key contribution of the chapter is the development of a new surrogate fitness model based on the search distributions. With this method the evolution starts in the fitness landscape, switches to the log-probability landscape of the model and then backtracks to continue in the original landscape if the optimum is not found.

There is particular interest in metal-insulator-metal-based plasmonic metamaterial absorbers (MIM-PMAs) due to their complete fulfillment of these demands. MIM-PMAs consist of top periodic micropatches, a middle dielectric layer, and a bottom reflector layer to generate strong localized surface plasmon resonance at absorption wavelengths. In particular, in the visible and infrared (IR) wavelength regions, a wide range of applications is expected, such as solar cells, refractive index sensors, optical camouflage, cloaking, optical switches, color pixels, thermal IR sensors, IR microscopy and gas sensing. The promising properties of MIM-PMAs are attributed to the simple plasmonic resonance localized at the top micropatch resonators formed by the MIMs. Here, various types of MIM-PMAs are reviewed in terms of their historical background, basic physics, operation mode design, and future challenges to clarify their underlying basic design principles and introduce various applications.

They have been widely investigated for optical applications such as holograms, wavefront shaping, and structural color printing, however, electron-beam lithography is not suitable to produce large-area metasurfaces because of the high fabrication cost and low productivity. Although alternative optical technologies, such as holographic lithography and plasmonic lithography, can overcome these drawbacks, such methods are still constrained by the optical diffraction limit. To break through this fundamental problem, mechanical nanopatterning processes have been actively studied in many fields, with nanoimprint lithography (NIL) coming to the forefront. Since NIL replicates the nanopattern of the mold regardless of the diffraction limit, NIL can achieve sufficiently high productivity and patterning resolution, giving rise to an explosive development in the fabrication of metasurfaces. In this review, we focus on various NIL technologies for the manufacturing of metasurfaces. First, we briefly describe conventional NIL and then present various NIL methods for the scalable fabrication of metasurfaces. We also discuss recent applications of NIL in the realization of metasurfaces. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on each method and suggest perspectives for future research on the high-throughput fabrication of active metasurfaces.},

  abstract = {Low-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials can harness tightly confined polaritonic waves to deliver unique advantages for nanophotonic biosensing. The reduced dimensionality of vdW materials, as in the case of two-dimensional graphene, can greatly enhance plasmonic field confinement, boosting sensitivity and efficiency compared to conventional nanophotonic devices that rely on surface plasmon resonance in metallic films. Furthermore, the reduction of dielectric screening in vdW materials enables electrostatic tunability of different polariton modes, including plasmons, excitons, and phonons. One-dimensional vdW materials, particularly single-walled carbon nanotubes, possess unique form factors with confined excitons to enable single-molecule detection as well as in vivo biosensing. We discuss basic sensing principles based on vdW materials, followed by technological challenges such as surface chemistry, integration, and toxicity. Finally, we highlight progress in harnessing vdW materials to demonstrate new sensing functionalities that are difficult to perform with conventional metal/dielectric sensors.},

The electrical and optical constants and polarization-reversal properties of these ceramics were determined as functions of grain size and porosity. When poled PLZT ceramics were aged, the polarization-reversal characteristic was quite asymmetric, apparently because a space-charge field, E8p, was generated during aging. From a detailed study of the behavior of the E8p, including its (1) generation with increasing aging time, (2) relaxation with repeated polarization reversals, (3) relaxation by heat depolarization, and (4) grain-size and porosity dependence, it is concluded that the space-charge layer is present inside every domain. This layer also explains the grain-size dependencies of the remanent polarization, piezoelectric constants, and Curie point.},

In this framework, the long-term promise of reconfigurable metamaterial theory (i.e., the possibility to change the EM response of a 2-D/3-D material arbitrarily and in real time) has given the designers an extremely wide number of new degrees of freedom for the synthesis of innovative adaptive systems. Moreover, successful experimental validations of reconfigurable metamaterials in the entire EM spectrum from microwaves to optical frequencies have further stimulated academic and industrial interests in developing devices with enhanced performances, efficiency, and robustness. Nevertheless, the exploitation of reconfigurable metamaterials in commercial devices is still an open problem with several challenges from both the theoretical and technological viewpoints. This paper is then aimed at reviewing the latest advances on reconfigurable metamaterial engineering from the methodological perspective also providing a comprehensive and balanced survey on latest concepts, current trends, and envisaged future developments on this active field of research.},

  abstract = {The problem of the reduced dielectric response in thin films of high-permittivity materials is analyzed by studying the soft-mode response in several SrTiO3 thin films by means of Fourier transform far infrared, monochromatic submillimeter, and micro-Raman spectroscopies. A 300-nm-thick metalorganic chemical vapor deposition film, quasiepitaxially grown on a (0001) sapphire substrate with a perfect {$\langle$}111{$\rangle$} orientation, displays a ferroelectric transition near 125 K induced by a tensile residual stress, appearing apparently simultaneously with the antiferrodistortive transition. On the other hand, polycrystalline chemical solution deposition films grown on (0001) sapphire, and also tensile stressed, show a harder soft mode response without the appearance of macroscopic ferroelectricity. This effect, which increases with the film thickness, is explained by a strong depolarizing field induced by the percolated porosity and cracks (in the 10-nm scale) along the boundaries of columnar grains (normal to the probe field direction). Brick-wall model calculations showed that 0.2 vol. \% of such a porosity type reduces the permittivity from 30000 to less than 1000. The activation of the forbidden IR modes in the Raman spectra in the whole 80\textendash 300-K temperature range studied is explained by the effect of polar grain boundaries, in analogy with the bulk ceramics.},

The electromagnetic responses of SSM were found to be four resonances, namely dipolar, quadrupolar, octupolar and hexadecapolar plasmon resonances. They were generated from the interactions between SSM and perpendicularly incident terahertz waves. The sensing performances of SSM-based biochemical sensors were evaluated by changing ambient environments and analyte varieties. The highest values of sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) for SSM covered with analyte thin-films were 471 GHz/RIU (refraction index unit) and 94 RIU\&minus;1, respectively. In order to further investigate the biosensing ability of the proposed SSM device, dielectric hemispheres and microfluidic chips were adopted to imitate dry and hydrous biological specimens, respectively. The results show that the sensing abilities of SSM-based biochemical sensors could be enhanced by increasing either the number of hemispheres or the channel width of the microfluidic chip. The highest sensitivity was 405 GHz/RIU for SSM integrated with microfluidic chips. Finally, three more realistic models were simulated to imitate real sensing situations, and the corresponding highest sensitivity was 502 GHz/RIU.

Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit QED. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

In the finest ceramics the permittivity reduces below 1000 and a tendency to linearization of the permittivity vs field dependence is observed. The composite structure of ferroelectric ceramics corresponding to ferroelectric grain cores separated by nonferroelectric grain boundaries determines a progressive increase of the electrical inhomogeneity of the system with decreasing GS. The local electric field was computed at various applied voltages for different GSs by a finite element approach, and then the effective permittivity-field response {$\varepsilon$}eff(E) was determined by taking into consideration the local field distribution. A remarkable agreement between the model and experimental data was obtained for BaTiO3 ceramics. The local field distribution explains with considerable accuracy the reduction of permittivity and tunability observed with decreasing GS as well as the tendency towards linearization of {$\varepsilon$}eff(E) in nanoceramics.},

Here we illustrate how a semi-analytical model can be used to quickly identify promising non-periodic spatial arrangements of nanoscale scatterers. This model only requires basic knowledge of the scattering behaviour of a chosen nanostructure and the waveguiding properties of the semiconductor layer in a cell. Due to its simplicity, it provides new intuition into the ideal amount of disorder in high-performance light-trapping layers. Using simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that arrays of nanometallic stripes featuring a limited amount of disorder, for example, following a quasi-periodic or Fibonacci sequence, can substantially enhance solar absorption over perfectly periodic and random arrays.},

  abstract = {We study optical spectra when circularly polarized light normally impinges on a structurally chiral medium (SCM) with variable pitch which locally has a point group symmetry. In this case, a structural period is defined as a length along the nonhomogeneity axis, where the director rotates a full turn. We considered three different pitch gradients: (a) The pitch value is constant in each structural period and it uniformly increases or decreases in subsequent periods. (b) The pitch value linearly increases or decreases from the initial to the final structural period. (c) The pitch value linearly increases or decreases in a period, with identical periods in the slab. In the first and second case, spectra show a Bragg-type broad-band. It is broader as the difference between the initial and final pitch value in the SCM increases. However, for the third case, there are regions where waves are mainly transmitted as right circularly polarized (RCP) or left circularly polarized (LCP) waves. Inside these regions there are multiple narrow bands for both RCP and LCP waves. Meanwhile, reflexion is almost absent in the spectra except for the optical bands, where there is reflexion for RCP and LCP waves. Thus, spectra exhibit conversion of RCP waves in LCP (LCP in RCP) waves. Moreover, we found that the center frequency of the bands are harmonics of the center frequency of the first band.},

Here, we report an interesting manifestation of spin Hall effect of light and demonstrate its tunability in an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium exhibiting spatially varying retardance level. In our system, the beam shift occurs only for one circular polarization mode keeping the other orthogonal mode unaffected, which is shown to arise due to the combined spatial gradients of the geometric phase and the dynamical phase of light. The constituent two orthogonal circular polarization modes of an input linearly polarized light evolve in different trajectories, eventually manifesting as a large and tunable spin separation. The spin dependent beam shift and the demonstrated principle of simultaneously tailoring space-varying geometric and dynamical phase of light for achieving its tunability (of both magnitude and direction), may provide an attractive route towards development of spin-optical devices.},

As we deposit a dielectric film on a metamaterial, the resonant frequency shifts, but saturates at a specific thickness due to the limited sensing volume of the metamaterial. From the saturated value, we can extract the dielectric constants of various polymers that are transparent to the THz frequency range. In addition, we fabricated a microfluidic channel that contains the metamaterials to address the real dielectric constants for a polar liquid solution. This was possible due to an extremely confined electric field near the gap area of the metamaterials, enabling us to employ very thin liquid layers. We found that the resonance shifts do not depend critically on the imaginary dielectric constants, proving that our approach can be universal in terms of various materials, including absorptive materials. As an example, the dielectric constants of sodium chloride and potassium chloride solutions have been determined with various concentrations. Our experimental findings were successfully confirmed by finite-difference time-domain simulations.},

THz imaging is expected to help researchers and doctors attain a direct intuitive understanding of a cancerous area. THz spectroscopy is an efficient tool for component analysis of tissue samples to identify cancer biomarkers.

This DFT-TEM combination is then integrated into an iterative neural-network-optimization-based algorithm (PRIMES, parameter retrieval and inversion from multiple electron scattering) to retrieve nanometer-scale ferroelectric polarization domains and strain in theoretical bulklike specimens from TEM data. DFT and isolated-atom methods produce substantially different diffraction patterns and retrieved polarization domain parameters, and DFT is sufficient to retrieve strain properties from a silicon specimen simulated using experimentally derived structure factors. Thus, we show that the improved accuracy, fast computation, and intuitive integration make the GPAW DFT code well suited for three-dimensional materials characterization and demonstrate this using an iterative neural-network algorithm that is verifiable on the mesoscale and, with DFT integration, self-consistent on the nanoscale.},

(Similar approximations are found in scalar diffraction theory and in ray optics for curved surfaces.) In this paper, we develop a precise theory of such approximations for variable-impedance surfaces. Not only do we obtain a type of adiabatic theorem showing that the \&\#x0201C;zeroth-order\&\#x0201D; locally uniform approximation converges in the limit as the surface varies more and more slowly, including a way to quantify the rate of convergence, but we also obtain an infinite series of higher-order corrections. These corrections, which can be computed to any desired order by performing integral operations on the surface fields, allow rapidly varying surfaces to be modeled with arbitrary accuracy, and also allow one to validate designs based on the zeroth-order approximation (which is often surprisingly accurate) without resorting to expensive brute-force Maxwell solvers. We show that our formulation works arbitrarily close to the surface, and can even compute coupling to guided modes, whereas in the far-field limit our zeroth-order result simplifies to an expression similar to what has been used by other authors.},

A prediction of the optical constants of cermets is valuable in the choosing of a combination of metal and ceramic and in the optimization of the grading profile. The metallic inclusions are in general densely packed, and only those theories which include the effects of proximity are capable of yielding correct values. In order to complement previous work on the optical and transport properties of regular arrays of spheres, we solved the problem of cylindrical inclusions arranged in a square lattice. The calculations were checked by comparison with measurements for perfectly conducting cylinders. The optical constants of gold cylinders in alumina were calculated and were compared with those for spherical inclusions. It is shown that proximity effects are more pronounced for cylinders than for spheres. For the cases of cylindrical and spherical voids in a highly conducting medium it is shown that the Maxwell-Garnett theory is accurate to within 2\% for volume fractions of voids up to 0.50 and 0.40 respectively.},

This is an extension of ideas in previous metasurface designs, but with greatly increased flexibility, e.g. to automatically balance tradeoffs between multiple frequencies or to optimize a photonic device given only partial information about the desired field. Our approach even extends beyond the metasurface regime to non-subwavelength structures where additional diffracted orders must be included (but the period is not large enough to apply scalar diffraction theory).},

To analyse the response quantitatively, we used commercial Fourier transform IR and monochromatic backward-wave-oscillator spectroscopy in both transmission and reflection modes and a rigorous evaluation. The soft-mode behaviour is extremely sensitive to the sample quality, particularly in films, and correlates with the lower low-frequency response. The most important factors for this behaviour in the polycrystalline films are grain boundaries and porosity and nano-cracks, which often appear in thicker polycrystalline films along some of the grain boundaries. The brick-wall model for grain boundaries and cracks discussed within the generalized effective medium approximation appears to be appropriate for describing the observed phenomena. In quasi-epitaxial films the macroscopic tensile stress, which influences the phase diagram very sensitively and induces ferroelectricity even in the pure SrTiO3, seems to play the most important role. From the soft-mode behaviour and its splitting, it appears that in the studied BaTiO3 films all the phase transitions, as in single crystals, seem to be present, but smeared with phase coexistence regions down to 10 K. In the quasi-epitaxial BST-0.9 film a smeared ferroelectric transition appears near 150 K.},

For their practical implementation, it is imperative to maximize the metasurface efficiency. Topology optimization provides a pathway for pushing the limits of metasurface efficiency; however, topology optimization methods have been limited to the design of microscale devices due to the extensive computational resources that are required. We introduce a new strategy for optimizing large-area metasurfaces in a computationally efficient manner. By stitching together individually optimized sections of the metasurface, we can reduce the computational complexity of the optimization from high-polynomial to linear. As a proof of concept, we design and experimentally demonstrate large-area, high-numerical-aperture silicon metasurface lenses with focusing efficiencies exceeding 90\%. These concepts can be generalized to the design of multifunctional, broadband diffractive optical devices and will enable the implementation of large-area, high-performance metasurfaces in practical optical systems.},

Long-wavelength asymptotes to the dispersion curves based on homogenization theory are in good agreement with the numerical results for each of the four lattices. The slenderness ratio of the constituent beams of the lattice (or relative density) has a significant influence on the band structure. The techniques developed in this work can be used to design lattices with a desired band structure. The observed spatial filtering effects due to anisotropy at high frequencies (short wavelengths) of wave propagation are consistent with the lattice symmetries.},

In this paper, we present an evolutionary approach to HLS that extends previous works in three respects: (i) we exploit the NSGA-II, a multi-objective genetic algorithm, to fully automate the design space explorationwithout the need of any human intervention, (ii) we replace the expensive evaluation process of candidate solutions with a quite accurate regression model, and (iii) we reduce the number of evaluations with a fitness inheritance scheme. We tested our approach on several benchmark problems. Our results suggest that all the enhancements introduced improve the overall performance of the evolutionary search.},

Typically, spectral discretization is used in the finite periodic direction and spatial discretization in the orthogonal direction. In the light of the fact that the structures of interest often have a large width-to-height ratio and that the two discretization approaches have different computational complexities, we propose exchanging the directions for spatial and spectral discretization. Moreover, if the scatterer has repeating patterns, swapping the discretization directions facilitates the reuse of previous computations. Therefore, the new method is suited for scattering from objects with a finite number of periods, such as gratings, memory arrays, metamaterials, etc. Numerical experiments demonstrate a considerable reduction of the computational costs in terms of time and memory. For a specific test case considered in this paper, the new method (based on alternative discretization) is 40 times faster and requires 100 times less memory than the method based on classical discretization.},

The topological derivative is rigorously derived for the electromagnetic scattering problem and used as gradient descent direction to find local optima for the design of electromagnetic devices. We demonstrate that the resulting topology design algorithm is remarkably simple and efficient and naturally leads to binary designs, while depending only on the solution of the conventional finite element formulation for electrodynamics.

The procedure is based on a variational principle expressing the effective energy function of a given nonlinear composite in terms of the effective energy functions of the class of linear comparison composites. This provides an automatic procedure for converting well-known information for linear composites, in the form of estimates and bounds for their effective dielectric constants, into corresponding estimates and bounds for the effective behavior of nonlinear composites. Further, the procedure is easily implemented, and leads in some cases to exact results. Thus, exact estimates are given herein for isotropic weakly nonlinear composites with general nonlinearity, and bounds of the Hashin-Shtrikman type are given for the class of two-phase, isotropic dielectric composites with strongly and perfectly nonlinear constitutive behavior. The optimality of the bounds is addressed briefly.},

Devices built around these concepts allow for precise control of surface waves, often with structures that are subwavelength, and utilise Rainbow trapping that separates the signal spatially by frequency. Rainbow trapping yields large amplifications of displacement at the resonator positions where each frequency component accumulates. We investigate whether this amplification, and the associated control, can be used to create energy harvesting devices; the potential advantages and disadvantages of using graded resonant devices as energy harvesters is considered. We concentrate upon elastic plate models for which the A0 mode dominates, and take advantage of the large displacement amplitudes in graded resonant arrays of rods, to design innovative metasurfaces that trap waves for enhanced piezoelectric energy harvesting. Numerical simulation allows us to identify the advantages of such graded metasurface devices and quantify its efficiency, we also develop accurate models of the phenomena and extend our analysis to that of an elastic half-space and Rayleigh surface waves.},

The diffraction by classic isotropic gratings arises as a particular case of the derived equations; the case of anisotropic classic gratings was published elsewhere. The equations can be resolved either through classic differential theory or through the modal method for particular groove profiles. The new equations improve both methods in the same way. Crossed gratings, among which are grids and two-dimensional arbitrarily shaped periodic surfaces, appear as particular cases of the theory, as do three-dimensional photonic crystals. The method can be extended to nonperiodic media through the use of a Fourier transform.},

We propose a phenomenological correction to the static formulae using a realistic assumption for the electric field behavior inside the metal features. This approach allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the effective permittivity in the case when the electric field is not sufficiently homogeneous within the unit cell of the gratings. A comparison with the numerical results of the Fourier modal method demonstrates the validity of the analytical formulae. Additional study is made on the impedance approximation at the outer boundaries of the periodical structure in order to propose analytical formulae for the reflection coefficient that permits better correspondence with the numerical results. The link between the values of effective permittivity and permeability defined as the ratios between the averaged fields, and the metamaterial permittivity and permeability is discussed.},

A straightforward homogenization procedure leads to general expressions for the nonlinear susceptibilities of the composite metamaterial medium. The expressions are convenient, as they enable an inhomogeneous system of scattering elements to be described as a continuous medium using the standard notation of nonlinear optics. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of our theoretical framework by performing measurements on a fabricated metamaterial sample composed of an array of split ring resonators (SRRs) with packaged varactors embedded in the capacitive gaps, in a manner similar to that of Wang et al (2008 Opt. Express 16 16058). Because the SRRs exhibit a predominantly magnetic response to electromagnetic fields, the varactor-loaded SRR composite can be described as a magnetic material with nonlinear terms in its effective magnetic susceptibility. Treating the composite as a nonlinear effective medium, we can quantitatively assess the performance of the medium to enhance and facilitate nonlinear processes, including second harmonic generation, three- and four-wave mixing, self-focusing and other well-known nonlinear phenomena. We illustrate the accuracy of our approach by predicting the intensity-dependent resonance frequency shift in the effective permeability of the varactor-loaded SRR medium and comparing with experimental measurements.},

In this work we demonstrate that such mode superposition or `stacking' can be readily achieved through the careful structuring of a high-permittivity spherical shell, with either a metallic or a low permittivity dielectric (air) core. We examine the behaviour of these structures both as scatterers of plane wave radiation and as directive antennas. In the case where the core is metallic this leads to a superposition of the magnetic and electric modes of the same order, causing suppression of backscattering and unidirectional antenna emission. For an air core, an electric mode can superimpose with the next-highest order magnetic mode, the backscattered power is maximized and antenna emission is bidirectional. This is shown experimentally at microwave frequencies by observing the backscattering of core-shell spheres and we propose two antenna designs demonstrating different emission patterns defined by the superposition of multiple modes.},

Complementary experimental techniques (broadband methods versus resonant techniques, waveguide versus transmission line) and complementary data processing procedures (quasi-static theoretical approaches versus full-wave analysis) were selected to investigate the best way to characterize ferroelectric thin films. The measured data obtained from the cylindrical resonant cavity method, the experimental method that showed the least sources of uncertainty, were taken as reference values for comparisons with results obtained using broadband techniques. The error analysis on the methods used is discussed with regard to the respective domains of validity for each method; this enabled us to identify the best experimental approach for obtaining an accurate determination of the microwave dielectric properties of ferroelectric thin layers.},

The nonreciprocity of the cell permits the determination of the permeability tensor components in a single experimental phase. Complex permittivity and complex components of the permeability tensor are computed from a data-processing program, taking into account higher order modes excited at the cell discontinuities and using a numerical optimization procedure to match calculated and measured values of the S-parameters. We have studied the convergence of the calculated S-parameters as the number of modes taken into account in the calculations. Sensitivity to the input parameters for the optimization algorithm is discussed. A thru-reflect-line calibration in conjunction with a specific sample holder is used to eliminate systematic errors inherent in the S-parameter measurements.

  abstract = {Metasurfaces are thin two-dimensional metamaterial layers that allow or inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves in desired directions. For example, metasurfaces have been demonstrated to produce unusual scattering properties of incident plane waves or to guide and modulate surface waves to obtain desired radiation properties. These properties have been employed, for example, to create innovative wireless receivers and transmitters. In addition, metasurfaces have recently been proposed to confine electromagnetic waves, thereby avoiding undesired leakage of energy and increasing the overall efficiency of electromagnetic instruments and devices. The main advantages of metasurfaces with respect to the existing conventional technology include their low cost, low level of absorption in comparison with bulky metamaterials, and easy integration due to their thin profile. Due to these advantages, they are promising candidates for real-world solutions to overcome the challenges posed by the next generation of transmitters and receivers of future high-rate communication systems that require highly precise and efficient antennas, sensors, active components, filters, and integrated technologies. This Roadmap is aimed at binding together the experiences of prominent researchers in the field of metasurfaces, from which explanations for the physics behind the extraordinary properties of these structures shall be provided from viewpoints of diverse theoretical backgrounds. Other goals of this endeavour are to underline the advantages and limitations of metasurfaces, as well as to lay out guidelines for their use in present and future electromagnetic devices. This Roadmap is divided into five sections: 1. Metasurface based antennas. In the last few years, metasurfaces have shown possibilities for advanced manipulations of electromagnetic waves, opening new frontiers in the design of antennas. In this section, the authors explain how metasurfaces can be employed to tailor the radiation properties of antennas, their remarkable advantages in comparison with conventional antennas, and the future challenges to be solved. 2. Optical metasurfaces. Although many of the present demonstrators operate in the microwave regime, due either to the reduced cost of manufacturing and testing or to satisfy the interest of the communications or aerospace industries, part of the potential use of metasurfaces is found in the optical regime. In this section, the authors summarize the classical applications and explain new possibilities for optical metasurfaces, such as the generation of superoscillatory fields and energy harvesters. 3. Reconfigurable and active metasurfaces. Dynamic metasurfaces are promising new platforms for 5G communications, remote sensing and radar applications. By the insertion of active elements, metasurfaces can break the fundamental limitations of passive and static systems. In this section, we have contributions that describe the challenges and potential uses of active components in metasurfaces, including new studies on non-Foster, parity-time symmetric, and non-reciprocal metasurfaces. 4. Metasurfaces with higher symmetries. Recent studies have demonstrated that the properties of metasurfaces are influenced by the symmetries of their constituent elements. Therefore, by controlling the properties of these constitutive elements and their arrangement, one can control the way in which the waves interact with the metasurface. In this section, the authors analyze the possibilities of combining more than one layer of metasurface, creating a higher symmetry, increasing the operational bandwidth of flat lenses, or producing cost-effective electromagnetic bandgaps. 5. Numerical and analytical modelling of metasurfaces. In most occasions, metasurfaces are electrically large objects, which cannot be simulated with conventional software. Modelling tools that allow the engineering of the metasurface properties to get the desired response are essential in the design of practical electromagnetic devices. This section includes the recent advances and future challenges in three groups of techniques that are broadly used to analyze and synthesize metasurfaces: circuit models, analytical solutions and computational methods.},

  abstract = {Recently, it was revealed that conventional gradient metasurfaces are fundamentally limited on their overall efficiency to reroute the impinging waves towards arbitrary directions in reflection and transmission. Their efficiency is particularly limited for extreme wavefront transformations. In addition, due to the fastly varying impedance profiles that these surfaces require, they usually need high-resolution fabrication processes, limiting their applicability and overall bandwidth of operation. To address these issues, the concept of metagrating was recently introduced, enabling engineered surfaces capable of manipulating light with unitary efficiency even in the limit of extreme wavefront manipulation. Metagratings are periodic or locally periodic arrays operated in the few-diffraction order regime. Their unit cell contains carefully designed scatterers that, in contrast with conventional metasurfaces, do not need to support a continuous gradient of surface impedance, and consequently are far simpler to fabricate and can afford broader bandwidths because of the larger footprint of the constituent elements. Tailoring the coupling towards the few available diffraction channels, metagratings enable wavefront transformations with high efficiency. In this paper, we review the physical mechanisms behind the functionality of metagratings and provide an overview and outlook of the recent progress in this field of science and technology.},

The strong sensitivity to perturbations around the EP has been suggested for sensing applications. Nevertheless, the characteristics of such highly sensitive systems can be affected by unwanted perturbations during the fabrication process. However, if one can control perturbation, it can be considered as an additional degree of freedom to create and tune EPs, enabling fascinating phenomena. In this paper, we propose an analytical method to investigate such systems. We analytically derive the general conditions of EPs in the perturbed pair of coupled ring resonators, where both resonators can be perturbed by different scatterers. Several numerical examples are employed to verify the proposed analytical method. We propose a simple experimental scheme where the predicted effects can be confirmed. It is also shown that by changing the relative position of the scatterers with respect to each other, quite interesting states such as a chiral EP in one resonator or simultaneous chiral EPs in both resonators could be observed, making such a system a highly functional tunable device which can have several applications such as quantized reflection/transmission and q-bits.},

The driven-voltage permeability is first predicted using a finite element method-based multiphysics calculation. The simulation allows us to determine a magnetic anisotropy field of 45 Oe induced in the ferromagnetic layers by the mechanical coupling between magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers due to the applied dc voltage. A variation of 30\% for the permeability of the ferromagnetic layers is then measured using a radiofrequency permeameter and under the application of a dc voltage of 15 V applied on the ferromagnetic layers, which also act as electrodes for the bias of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). An additional measurement of the trilayered structure under the application of a dc magnetic field is finally performed to evaluate the magnetic field needed to get a 30\% variation in the magnetic layers permeability in order to compare this value to the one predicted by multiphysics calculation. These experimental results are in good agreement with calculations and are very encouraging for the application of the CoFeB/PVDF/CoFeB composite material to ensure the tunability of microwave devices (filters, phase shifters, antennas, etc.)},

Considering the singly graded periodic structure, the transmittance reveals a series of photonic bands and gaps, exhibiting maxima less than unity, as for the singly graded slab, and tending to saturate in a periodic sequence of centro-symmetric columnar peaks, separated by gaps of identical widths, at large frequencies; an asset that recommends this type of photonic structure as ideal. Looking at the doubly graded periodic structure, the transmittance reveals two series of photonic bands and gaps, exhibiting maxima of full transparency, as for the doubly graded slab, or maxima of reduced transparency and tending to saturate in essentially constant values with zero gaps at large frequencies; a trait known for all frequencies from an optically homogeneous, non-dispersive medium of semi-infinite extent.

  abstract = {The interaction of circularly polarized light with matter is the basis for molecular circular dichroism spectroscopy, optical spin manipulation, and optical torques. However, chiroptical effects are usually hampered by weak chiral light\textendash matter interaction. Nanophotonic structures can enhance optical intensity to boost interactions, but magnifying chiral effects requires that the near field remains chiral in the process. Here, we propose the conditions and limits for enhancing different chiroptical effects near achiral metasurfaces with maximum chirality of the evanescent fields. We illustrate these conditions with arrays of metal and dielectric nanodisks and decompose their distinct electromagnetic metrics into propagating and evanescent Fourier orders. We prove that a nanostructure cannot be universally optimal for different chirality metrics and therefore applications. For example, arrays tailored for enhanced spin excitation with spatially uniform circular polarization destroy circular dichroism. Conversely, we predict a limit of maximum attainable circular dichroism in highly evanescent Fourier orders through a simple relation with the evanescent wavevector and polarization. Our results establish guidelines and constraints for nanophotonic enhancement using evanescent fields in diverse chiroptical applications.},

We use a novel method to find the pattern with the widest TM-polarized gap for two-component materials. Patterns are obtained by computing a finite sum of density waves, assigning regions where the sum exceeds a threshold to a material with one dielectric constant, {$\epsilon$}1, and all other regions to another, {$\epsilon$}0. Compared to optimized crystals, optimized quasicrystals have larger gaps at low constrasts {$\epsilon$}1/{$\epsilon$}0 and have gaps that are much more isotropic for all contrasts. For high contrasts, optimized hexagonal crystals have the largest gaps.},

By varying the applied voltage along with the cells' movement, a PNLC with a gradient refractive index distribution is obtained. In comparison with conventional approaches using patterned photomask or electrode, our method offers following advantages: large refractive index change, freedom to design specific index profile, and large panel capability.

This has advanced research interests in nanoscale ferroelectric properties. In the current study, a phase-field model is used as a research tool to explore nanoscale behaviour of barium titanate. The model is first used to design and optimize nano-actuator concepts that generate actuation strains \textasciitilde 0.45\%. This strain is four times as large as the strain offered by piezoceramic actuators in market. Next, the model is used to describe how scaling and surface conditions affect the formation of nanoscale polarization patterns, such as vortices. The results demonstrate the dominant effect of surface conditions and explain experimental observations of phase, tetragonality and polarization patterns in ferroelectric nanoparticles. The phase-field model is next extended to three dimensions and is used to test the stability of nanoscale periodic polarization patterns. The results describe the internal stress and electric fields developed in these patterns, and illustrate a mechanism of how complex polarization patterns can be formed under external strain or electric fields. Here, a conceptual design of an energy harvester is also explored.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The current work explores the application of a phase-field model as a design tool to develop nano-actuator and energy harvester concepts.

The results on the effects of scaling, surface energy and external loads on nanoscale polarization patterns, explains prior experimental observations of polarization patterns and provide useful insights on how to engineer domain configurations for nanoscale applications.

With an object-oriented program structure written in a Python/C++ layered fashion, VeloxChem enables time-efficient prototyping of novel scientific approaches without sacrificing computational efficiency, so that molecular systems involving up to and beyond 500 second-row atoms (or some 10,000 contracted and in part diffuse Gaussian basis functions) can be routinely addressed. In addition, VeloxChem is equipped with a polarizable embedding scheme for the treatment of the classical electrostatic interactions with an environment that in turn is modeled by atomic site charges and polarizabilities. The underlying hybrid message passing interface (MPI)/open multiprocessing (OpenMP) parallelization scheme makes VeloxChem suitable for execution in high-performance computing cluster environments, showing even slightly beyond linear scaling for the Fock matrix construction with use of up to 16,384 central processing unit (CPU) cores. An efficient\textemdash with respect to convergence rate and overall computational cost\textemdash multifrequency/gradient complex linear response equation solver enables calculations not only of conventional spectra, such as visible/ultraviolet/X-ray electronic absorption and circular dichroism spectra, but also time-resolved linear response signals as due to ultra-short weak laser pulses.

  abstract = {Let's boot up a quantum computer. Far from being a simple push of a button, initializing a prototype quantum computer requires the precise tuning and calibration of many different parameters. Rather than switching transistors on and off, the controller of a quantum processor emits combinations of analog waveforms, each with a characteristic shape, frequency, and duration. These waveforms are used to either manipulate or read out the states of quantum bits (qubits), the basic units of quantum information in the processor. The analog nature of the system inherits many of the complexities of analog computing, including device parameter drift and offsets, system component tolerances and variabilities, and other well-known analog-circuit intricacies. Further, de livering these signals to the target qubits necessitates coordination between multiple low-noise and low-jitter instruments. In spite of these challenges, the quantum computing community has made tremendous progress toward useful quantum machines. We hope to provide an instructive introduction to the control, signal generation, and distribution principles currently used in small quantum systems that operate in the microwave frequency regime.},

These near fields give the carrier generation rate, and their accurate determination is essential for device modeling. We implement two techniques for increasing the accuracy of the near fields generated by RCWA and give some guidance on parameters required for convergence along with an estimate of their associated computation times. The first improvement removes Gibbs phenomenon artifacts from the RCWA fields, and the second uses the extremely well-converged far-field absorption to rescale the local fields. These improvements allow a computational speedup between 30 and 1000 times for spectrally integrated calculations, depending on the density of the near fields desired. Some spectrally resolved quantities, especially at short wavelengths, remain expensive, but RCWA is still an excellent method for performing those calculations. These improvements open up the possibility of using RCWA for low-cost optical modeling in a full optoelectronic device model of nanowire solar cells.},

These image-dipole effects are generally not taken into account in single-emitter tracking and super-resolved imaging applications. Here we show that the interference between an emitter and its image dipole induces a strong polarization anisotropy and a large spatial displacement of the observed emission pattern. We demonstrate these effects by tracking the emission of a single quantum dot along two orthogonal polarizations as it is deterministically positioned near a silver nanowire. The two orthogonally polarized diffraction spots can be displaced by up to 50\,nm, which arises from a Young's interference effect between the quantum dot and its induced image dipole. We show that the observed spatially varying interference fringe provides a useful measure for correcting image-dipole-induced distortions. These results provide a pathway towards probing and correcting image-dipole effects in near-field imaging applications.},

A central stepping stone toward realizing this promise is the demonstration of multifunctionality under several constraints (e.g., at multiple incident wavelengths and/or angles) in a single device, an achievement being hampered by design limitations inherent to single-layer planar geometries. Here, we propose a framework for the inverse design of multilayer metaoptics via topology optimization, showing that even few-wavelength thick devices can achieve high-efficiency multifunctionality, such as multiangle light concentration and plan-achromaticity. We embody our framework in multiple closely spaced patterned layers of a low-index polymer, with fabrication constraints specific to this platform enforced in the optimization process. We experimentally demonstrate our approach with an inverse-designed 3D-printed light concentrator working at five different nonparaxial angles of incidence. Our framework paves the way toward realizing multifunctional ultracompact 3D nanophotonic devices.},

Although significant progress has been made over the previous two decades, substantial engineering efforts are required to scale these devices so they can be used to solve many problems of interest. Unfortunately, much of this exciting field is described using technical jargon and concepts from physics that are unfamiliar to a classically trained electromagnetic engineer. As a result, this work is often difficult for engineers to become engaged in. We hope to lower the barrier to this field by providing an accessible review of one of the most prevalently used quantum bits (qubits) in superconducting circuit systems, the transmon qubit. Most of the physics of these systems can be understood intuitively with only some background in quantum mechanics. As a result, we avoid invoking quantum mechanical concepts except where it is necessary to ease the transition between details in this work and those that would be encountered in the literature. We believe this leads to a gentler introduction to this fascinating field, and hope that more researchers from the classical electromagnetic community become engaged in this area in the future.},

  abstract = {Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is one of the most powerful techniques to characterise the far infrared response of materials and devices. Based on the use of short electromagnetic waveforms generated by rectifying femtosecond optical pulses delivered by a mode-locked laser, it allows, within one single experiment, the determination of the optical constants of materials over a wide frequency spectrum ranging from 100 GHz up to several THz. Thanks to its large dynamics and its ability to give both amplitude and phase of the transmitted, reflected or scattered THz fields, this technique addresses a large panel of scientific studies. In this chapter, one introduces the principles of THz-TDS. First, the characteristics and performances of a classical set-up are described, then the extraction of the refractive index and absorption coefficient of the studied device from its complex experimental transmission or reflection coefficients are explained. As a demonstration of the power of this technique, one presents some results of thin film spectroscopy and recent studies of left-handed metamaterials. Finally, a detailed analysis of the precision of determined optical constants is given. One will treat not only the classical transmission scheme, but also the reflection regime that is mandatory in the study of strongly absorbing media.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization of structures and composite materials is a new and rapidly expanding field of mechanics which now plays an ever-increasing role in most branches of technology, such as aerospace, mechanical, structural, civil and ma\- terials engineering, with important implications for energy production as well as building and environmental sciences. It is a truly "high-tech" field which requires advanced computer facilities and computational methods, whilst involving unusual theoretical considerations in pure mathematics. Topology optimization deals with some of the most difficult problems of mechanical sciences, but it is also of consid\- erable practical interest because it can achieve much greater savings than conven\- tional (sizing or shape) optimization. Extensive research into topology optimization is being carried out in most of the developed countries of the world. The workshop addressed the state of the art of the field, bringing together re\- searchers from a diversity of backgrounds (mathematicians, information scientists, aerospace, automotive, mechanical, structural and civil engineers) to span the full breadth and depth of the field and to outline future developments in research and avenues of cooperation between NATO and Partner countries. The program cov\- ered \textbullet{} theoretical (mathematical) developments, \textbullet{} computer algorithms, software development and computational difficulties, and \textbullet{} practical applications in various fields of technology. A novel feature of the workshop was that, in addition to shorter discussions after each lecture, a 30 minutes panel discussion took place in each sesssion, which made this ARW highly interactive and more informal.},

We use topology optimization to design the layout of a multilayer structure consisting of structural, piezoelectric, and electrode layers, as well as the electrical circuit. The flexibility of our formalism admits the definition of specific system-level objectives, e.g., maximize the power harvested, in an algebraic fashion. After describing our analysis and design approaches, we present examples that demonstrate the versatility of our approach and show how it can be used to explore general behavior and develop overarching design principles for piezoelectric energy harvesting devices. For the objective of maximizing the power harvested, we investigate: (i) optimal designs for various piezoelectric to substrate thickness ratios, (ii) the effect of mass loading on optimal design, and (iii) the sensitivity of designs to shape variations.},

The question is how to distinguish these two types of periodic structures when their parameters, such as permittivity and lattice constant, vary continuously. Here we discuss transition between photonic crystals and dielectric metamaterials and introduce the concept of a phase diagram, based on the physics of Mie and Bragg resonances. We show that a periodic photonic structure transforms into a metamaterial when the Mie gap opens up below the lowest Bragg bandgap where the homogenization approach can be justified and the effective permeability becomes negative. Our theoretical approach is confirmed by microwave experiments for a metacrystal composed of tubes filled with heated water. This analysis yields deep insight into the properties of periodic structures, and provides a useful tool for designing different classes of electromagnetic materials with variable parameters.},

When the magnetic field is assumed to be variable, the rotation can be adjusted through the change in the magnetic induced permittivity of the magneto-optical layer. Since our investigation revealed that the rotation can be adjusted precisely, it is suggested that the use of multiple films with a rotation of half or one-third of 45\textdegree{} would make it possible to assemble low loss isolators.},

This photoresist is basically a ceramic slurry containing a photocurable agent and a photoinitiator to be crosslinkable with the 780~\hspace{0pt}nm wavelength femtosecond laser light source of the 2PP machine. It is demonstrated that it is possible to gain a highly transparent and low viscous slurry suitable for 2PP processing.

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms have been very popular for solving multiobjective optimization problems, mainly because of their ease of use, and their wide applicability. However, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) tend to consume an important number of objective function evaluations, in order to achieve a reasonably good approximation of the Pareto front. This is a major concern when attempting to use MOEAs for real-world applications, since we can normally afford only a fairly limited number of fitness function evaluations in such cases. Despite these concerns, relatively few efforts have been reported in the literature to reduce the computational cost of MOEAs. It has been until relatively recently, that researchers have developed techniques to achieve an effective reduction of fitness function evaluations by exploiting knowledge acquired during the search. In this chapter, we analyze different proposals currently available in the specialized literature to deal with expensive functions in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Additionally, we review some real-world applications of these methods, which can be seen as case studies in which such techniques led to a substantial reduction in the computational cost of the MOEA adopted. Finally, we also indicate some of the potential paths for future research in this area.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate dynamic tuning of electric and magnetic resonances in all-dielectric silicon nanodisk metasurfaces in the telecom spectral range based on the temperature-dependent refractive-index change of a nematic liquid crystal. We achieve a maximum resonance tuning range of 40 nm and a pronounced change in the transmittance intensity up to a factor of 5. Strongly different tuning rates are observed for the electric and the magnetic response, which allows for dynamically adjusting the spectral mode separation. Furthermore, we experimentally investigate the influence of the anisotropic (temperature-dependent) dielectric environment provided by the liquid crystal on both the electric and magnetic resonances. We demonstrate that the phase transition of the liquid crystal from its nematic to its isotropic phase can be used to break the symmetry of the optical metasurface response. As such, our approach allows for spectral tuning of electric and magnetic resonances of all-dielectric metasurfaces as well as switching of the anisotropy of the optical response of the device.},

The periodic sub-wavelength ({$\lambda$}0/25) unit-cells are composed of capacitive and inductive structures creating a bandpass for an incident wave. By patterning the capacitive elements on a screen-printed barium-strontium-titanate (BST) thick-film ceramic, the resonant frequency of the FSS can be tuned. This technology offers a simple and cost effective way for integrating varactors into the FSS and is particularly attractive for microwave circuits with a high varactor density. A prototype is fabricated including two capacitive layers with an overall size of 40 mm \texttimes{} 40 mm. Each layer includes a total of 1600 integrated BST varactors that are fabricated by using a patterning and metallization process. A transmitted wave passing through the FSS will experience a phase shift, which can be tuned by tuning the passband. This allows steering the transmitted wave to a certain direction by applying a phase gradient along the FSS interface. A phase shift range of 360\textdegree{} can be covered by cascading several FSS panels. The prototyped tunable FSS demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed technology and its potential for beam steering.},

The array employs continuously tunable phase shifters based on a screen printed barium-strontium-titanate thick-film ceramic. Due to the use of artificial transmission line topology, the proposed phase-shifter design has a very compact size (3 mm \texttimes{} 2.8 mm) for 342\textdegree{} total phase shift. In the frequency range from 8 to 10 GHz, it exhibits a figure of merit {$>$};52\textdegree/dB, which is among the best of phase shifters based on ferroelectric thick films. In a prototyped phased array, the RF circuit consists of a feeding network, phase shifters, and antenna elements, which are integrated into one planar metallization layer. Furthermore, a simple way for routing bias lines for phase shifters is demonstrated using high resistive electrodes. Using screen printed thick films and applying a simplified fabrication process for the RF and bias circuitry can reduce the total expense of phased arrays considerably.},

The program solves rigorously the Maxwell equations~via the superposition T-matrix method, where incident and scattered fields are decomposed into series of vector spherical waves. terms implements several algorithms to solve the coupled system of multiple scattering equations~that describes the electromagnetic interaction between neighbouring scatterers. From this formal solution, the program can compute a number of physically-relevant optical properties, such as far-field cross-sections~for extinction, absorption, scattering and their corresponding circular dichroism, as well as local field intensities and degree of optical chirality. By describing the incident and scattered fields in a basis of spherical waves the T-matrix framework lends itself to analytical formulas for orientation-averaged quantities, corresponding to systems of particles in random orientation; terms offers such computations for both far-field and near-field quantities of interest. This user guide introduces the program, summarises the relevant theory, and is supplemented by a comprehensive suite of stand-alone examples in the website accompanying the code.},

This review follows a logical sequence starting from density functional theory as the representative instance of electronic structure methods, to the subsequent high-throughput approach, used to generate large amounts of data. Ultimately, data-driven strategies which include data mining, screening, and machine learning techniques, employ the data generated. We show how these approaches to modern computational materials science are being used to uncover complexities and design novel materials with enhanced properties.

The thermodynamic framework rests upon Gurtin's notion of a micro-force system in conjunction with an associated micro-force balance. This leads to a formulation of the second law, from which a generalized Ginzburg\textendash Landau evolution equation is derived. The invariant formulation of the thermodynamic potential provides a consistent way to obtain the order parameter dependent elastic stiffness, piezoelectric, and dielectric tensor. The model is reduced to 2d and implemented into a finite element framework. The material constants used in the simulations are adapted to meet the thermodynamic condition of a vanishing micro-force. It is found that the thermodynamic potential taken from the literature has to be extended in order to avoid a loss of positive definiteness of the stiffness and the dielectric tensor. The small-signal response is investigated in the presence and in the absence of the additional regularizing terms in the potential. The simulations show the pathological behavior of the model in case these terms are not taken into account. The paper closes with microstructure simulations concerning a ferroelectric nanodot subjected to an electric field, a cracked single crystal, and a ferroelectric bi-crystal.},

Stress analysis leads to a linear system of equations that is typically solved by an iterative solver (e.g. GMRES). To ensure accuracy, the adjoint problem is formulated as a new linear system of equations to be solved. Vibration analysis results in a generalized eigenvalue problem that is also typically solved by an interative solver. The adjoint problem takes out the generalized eigenvalue solve and replaces it by one outer product per eigenfrequency, leading to significantly cheap eigenfrequency gradients for vibration analysis.},

The early work, largely at IBM, RCA, Bell Telephone Laboratories and other US industrial laboratories was stymied by two problems: Firstly, the materials were too thick to permit operation at 5 V, the standard ``TTL'' or ``CMOS'' operating voltages in the silicon integrated circuit technology that dominates the microelectronics industry; and second, there is considerable ``crosstalk'' and unintentional switching of cells laid out in simple row-and-column matrix form. In the 1990s, however, the perspective is very different: Techniques for depositing very thin, pinholefree films have developed significantly in the past three decades; at present sputtering, sol-gel spinon, laser ablation, and various other techniques (MOD, MOCVD, etc.) can all be used to prepare optically uniform films over full 4' to 6' wafers, capable of withstanding 4 MV/cm or more. And the old problem of cross-talk or ``half-select disturb pulses'' has been circumvented by designing memory arrays in which each ferroelectric cell is isolated from its neighbors by one or two transistors (``IT'' or ``2T'' DRAM architecture) or as many as six transistors (in a more conservative ``6T'' SRAM lay-out). As a result, there has been a renaissance of engineering interest in ferroelectric thin films.},

  abstract = {We show that silicon-based metagratings capable of large-angle, multifunctional performance can be realized using inverse freeform design. These devices consist of nonintuitive nanoscale patterns and support a large number of spatially overlapping optical modes per unit area. The quantity of modes, in combination with their optimized responses, provides the degrees of freedom required to produce high-efficiency devices. To demonstrate the power and versatility of our approach, we fabricate metagratings that can efficiently deflect light to 75\textdegree{} angles and multifunctional devices that can steer beams to different diffraction orders based on wavelength. A theoretical analysis of the Bloch modes supported by these devices elucidates the spatial mode profiles and coupling dynamics that make high-performance beam deflection possible. This approach represents a new paradigm in nano-optical mode engineering and utilizes different physics from the current state-of-the-art, which is based on the stitching of noninteracting waveguide structures. We envision that inverse design will enable new classes of high-performance photonic systems and new strategies toward the nanoscale control of light fields.},

  abstract = {The dissipative quantum electromagnetics is introduced in a comprehensive manner as a field-matter-bath coupling problem. First, the matter is described by a cluster of Lorentz oscillators. Then the Maxwellian free field is coupled to the Lorentz oscillators to describe a frequency dispersive medium. The classical Hamiltonian is derived for such a coupled system using Lorenz gauge and decoupled scalar and vector potential formulations. The classical equations of motion are derivable from the Hamiltonian using Hamilton equations. Then the Hamiltonian is quantized with all the pertinent variables with the introduction of commutators between the variables and their conjugate pairs. The quantum equations of motion can be derived using the quantum Hamilton equations. It can be shown that such a quantization scheme preserves the quantum commutators introduced. Then a noise bath consisting of simple harmonic oscillators is introduced and coupled to the matter consisting of Lorentz oscillators to induce quantum loss. Langevin source emerges naturally in such a procedure, and it can be shown that the results are consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and the quantization procedure of Welsch's group. The advantage of the present procedure is that no diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is necessary to arrive at the quantum equations of motion. Finally, we apply the quantization scheme to model spontaneous emission of a two-level polarized atom placed above a dielectric cylinder that supports a bound state in the continuum.},

  abstract = {Illusion thermotics, which aims at creating temperature fields to mislead a thermal detector, encompasses many thermal functionalities. It has attracted significant attention due to the increasing number of promising applications. Transformation thermotics and scattering cancellation methods are frequently adopted for illusion devices, though they have inherent defects such as anisotropic thermal properties and complicated fabrication methods. Here, we present a general framework for topology optimization, which can be used to design the structure of an illusion device automatically. The optimized configuration can camouflage the thermal exterior of an illusion device so that it is identical to a reference. The original heat source can drive the virtual heat source despite the structure being simply composed of natural materials. To establish an effective topology optimization model, a volume constraint was imposed on the total volume of iron and a prescribed objective function was used to evaluate the difference between the reference temperature and the temperature field during the topology optimization. The flexibility of the method presented was successfully validated by changing the total volume of iron, the number and locations of the thermal illusions, the types of composite materials, and the original heat sources. Topology optimization is a new and flexible approach for designing thermal metamaterials and metadevices for diverse thermal functionalities and beyond.},

With active components integrated into unit cells of the metasurface, states of the unit cells can be adjusted by digital codes. The metasurface can then construct complex spatial and temporal electromagnetic beams. Given the main parameters of the beam, the optimal codes can be computed by nonlinear optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, etc. The high computational complexity of these algorithms makes it very challenging to compute the codes in real time. In this study, we applied deep learning techniques to compute the codes. A deep convolutional neural network is designed and trained to compute the required element codes in milliseconds, given the requirement of the waveform. The average accuracy of the prediction reaches more than 94 percent. This scheme is validated on a 1-bit programmable metasurface and both experimental and numerical results agree with each other well. This study shows that machines may ``learn'' the physics of modulating electromagnetic waves with the help of the good generalization ability in deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed scheme may provide us with a possible solution for real-time complex beamforming in antenna arrays, such as the programmable metasurface.},

The transmission of the sample is dominated by the antisymmetric and symmetric resonant modes originating from the strong magneto-inductive and conductive coupling among the three SRRs, respectively. Numerical simulations and model calculations based on a coupled oscillator theory were performed to explain the modulation process. It is found that the graphene coating impairs the resonances by increasing the damping of the modes and decreasing the coupling between the SRRs whereas the strong THz field restores the resonances by decreasing the conductivity of graphene.},

  abstract = {Advances in additive manufacturing have recently made possible the manufacturing of smart materials with arbitrary microarchitectures, which leads to developing lightweight smart metamaterials with unprecedented multifunctional properties. In this paper, asymptotic homogenization (AH) method is developed for predicting the effective thermo-electro-mechanical properties of architected cellular piezoelectric metamaterials. The effect of pore microarchitecture (relative density and cell topology) and polarization direction on elastic, dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and thermal properties of periodic cellular piezoelectric metamaterials is explored. The pore topology is determined by Fourier series expansion. Alternative pore microarchitectures are considered by tailoring shape parameters, scaling factor, and rotation angle of the constitutive pore. Smart cellular metamaterials made of both single-phase (BaTiO3) and bi-phase (BaTiO3-expoy) piezoelectric materials are considered. Apart from effective thermo-electro-mechanical properties, a series of figures of merit for the cellular piezoelectric metamaterials, i.e. piezoelectric coupling constant, acoustic impedance, piezoelectric charge coefficient, hydrostatic figure of merit, current responsivity, voltage responsivity and pyroelectric energy harvesting figures of merit, are presented and the reason for difference between the figures of merit of different types of piezoelectric metamaterials is discussed. The figures of merit shed lights on the effect of microarchitecture on optimizing the multifunctional performance of smart cellular metamaterials for applications as structurally efficient multifunctional energy harvesters. It is found that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric figures of merit of cellular piezoelectric metamaterials can be significantly improved compared to the commonly used honeycomb cellular materials and composite materials with solid circular inclusion if an appropriate microarchitecture is selected for the pore. For example, piezoelectric charge coefficient (dh) for a transversely polarized single-phase cellular piezoelectric metamaterial with a solid volume fraction of 0.4 can be 350\% higher than the corresponding figures of merit of honeycomb piezoelectric material; voltage responsivity of transversely polarized bi-phase cellular piezoelectric metamaterials with an inclusion volume fraction of 0.3 can be also 249\% higher than the corresponding value of composite materials with a solid circular inclusion.},

However, most previous metasurfaces realized cloaking by using phase compensation, which is limited by the reflection phase formula and can be used only for reflection mode. We use the generalized Snell's law to propose a free-space transmission stealth device, consisting of multilayer all-dielectric metasurfaces. We utilize three phase gradient all-dielectric silicon metasurfaces that, respectively, play the role of beam splitting, steering, and collection to guide incident waves around the object, thereby forming an ideal stealth area in free space. All-dielectric metasurfaces can greatly reduce transmission loss and enhance efficiency to a large extent. The advantage of choosing an all-dielectric material is that it is easy to process and more suitable in practice. Simulation results of the near field and far field prove that this cloak has a cloaking effect at 1 THz. Our work opens up a new path for transmissive stealth.},

We begin by analyzing the size of the parameter space in polynomial regression in terms of the number of variables and the constraints on the polynomial degree and the number of interacting explanatory variables.We subsequently propose a new procedure for statistical estimation that relies upon cross-validation to select the optimal parameter subspace and an evolutionary algorithm to minimize risk within this subspace based upon the available data. This general purpose procedure can be shown to perform well in a variety of challenging multivariate estimation settings. Furthermore, the procedure is sufficiently flexible to allow the user to incorporate known causal structures into the estimate and to adjust computational parameters such as the population mutation rate according to the problem's specific challenges. Furthermore, the procedure can be shown to asymptotically converge to the globally optimal estimate. We compare this evolutionary algorithm to a variety of competitors over the course of simulation studies and in the context of a study of disease progression in diabetes patients.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for calculation of the band structure of photonic crystal slabs. This algorithm combines the plane-wave expansion method with perfectly matched layers for the termination of the computational region in the direction out of the plane. In addition, the effective-medium tensor is applied to improve convergence. A general complex eigenvalue problem is then obtained. Two criteria are presented to distinguish the guided modes from the PML modes. As such, this scheme can accurately determine the band structure both above and below the light cone. The convergence of the algorithm presented has been studied. The results obtained by using this algorithm have been compared with those obtained by the finite-difference time-domain method and found to agree very well.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) used in complex optimization domains usually need to perform a large number of fitness function evaluations in order to get near-optimal solutions. In real world application domains such as engineering design problems, such evaluations can be extremely computationally expensive. In some extreme cases there is no clear definition of the fitness function or the fitness function is too ambiguous to be deterministically evaluated. It is therefore common to estimate or approximate the fitness. A popular method is to construct a so-called surrogate or meta-model, which can simulate the behavior of the original fitness function, but can be evaluated much faster. An interesting trend is to use multiple surrogates to gain better performance in fitness approximation. In this chapter, an up-to-date survey of fitness approximation applied in evolutionary algorithms is presented. The main focus areas are the methods of fitness approximation, the working styles of fitness approximation, and the management of the approximation during the optimization process. To conclude, some open questions in this area are discussed.},

A numerical model of the device that predicts a resonant frequency as a function of BST dielectric constant is presented. The resonant frequency shift due to the applied DC bias is experimentally verified and correlated with the model. The resonant frequency shift occurs as a direct result of the bias controlled index of refraction change in BST which significantly enhances the device response speed and durability compared with previously demonstrated micro-electro-mechanical systems based tunable metamaterial devices. In addition, this device can be used to characterize dielectric properties of the tunable oxide thin films in low THz spectrum (such as tunability) for many applications.},

  abstract = {Optical micro-resonators have broad applications. They are used, for example, to enhance light\textendash matter interactions in optical sensors or as model systems for investigating fundamental physical mechanisms in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Coupling two or more micro-cavities is particularly interesting as it enlarges the design freedom and the field of application. In this context, achieving tunability of the coupling strength and hence the inter-cavity gap is of utmost importance for adjusting the properties of the coupled micro-resonator system. In this paper, we report on a novel coupling approach that allows highly precise tuning of the coupling gap of polymeric micro-resonators that are fabricated side by side on a common substrate. We structure goblet-shaped whispering-gallery-mode resonators on an elastic silicone-based polymer substrate by direct laser writing. The silicone substrate is mechanically stretched in order to exploit the lateral shrinkage to reduce the coupling gap. Incorporating a laser dye into the micro-resonators transforms the cavities into micro-lasers that can be pumped optically. We have investigated the lasing emission by micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, focusing on the spatial localization of the modes. Our results demonstrate the formation of photonic molecules consisting of two or even three resonators, for which the coupling strengths and hence the lasing performance can be precisely tuned. Flexibility and tunability are key elements in future photonics, making our approach interesting for various photonic applications. For instance, as our coupling approach can also be extended to larger cavity arrays, it might serve as a platform for tunable coupled-resonator optical waveguide devices.},

The construction problem can be called an inverse problem of finding a material with given homogenized coefficients. The inverse problem is formulated as a topology optimization problem i.e. finding the interior topology of a base cell such that cost is minimized and the constraints are defined by the prescribed constitutive parameters. Numerical values of the constitutive parameters of a given material are found using a numerical homogenization method expressed in terms of element mutual energies. Numerical results show that arbitrary materials, including materials with Poisson's ratio -1.0 and other extreme materials, can be obtained by modelling the base cell as a truss structure. Furthermore, a wide spectrum of materials can be constructed from base cells modelled as continuous discs of varying thickness. Only the two-dimensional case is considered in this paper but formulation and numerical procedures can easily be extended to the three-dimensional case.},

  abstract = {Currently developments of piezocomposite materials and piezoelectric actuators have been based on the use of simple analytical models, test of prototypes, and analysis using the finite element method (FEM), usually limiting the problem to a parametric optimization. By changing the topology of these devices or their components, we may obtain an improvement in their performance characteristics. Based on this idea, this paper discusses the application of topology optimization combined with the homogenization method and FEM for designing piezocomposite materials. The homogenization method allows us to calculate the effective properties of a composite material knowing its unit cell topology. New effective properties that improves the electromechanical efficiency of the piezocomposite material are obtained by designing the piezocomposite unit cell. This method consists of finding the distribution of the material and void phases in a periodic unit cell that optimizes the performance characteristics of the piezocomposite. The optimized solution is obtained using Sequential Linear Programming (SLP). A general homogenization method applied to piezoelectricity was implemented using the finite element method (FEM). This homogenization method has no limitations regarding volume fraction or shape of the composite constituents. The main assumptions are that the unit cell is periodic and that the scale of the composite part is much larger than the microstructure dimensions. Prototypes of the optimized piezocomposites were manufactured and experimental results confirmed the large improvement.},

  abstract = {In addition to the design of piezocomposite material, discussed by Silvaeet al. [1], another important issue is the design of the piezoelectric transducer. This paper introduces this issue by discussing the design of lowfrequency flextensional piezoelectric actuators. They consist of a piezoceramic (or a stack of piezoceramics) connected to a flexible mechanical structure that converts and amplifies the output displacement of the piezoceramic. The actuator performance depends on the distribution of stiffness and flexibility in the coupling structure domain, which is related to the coupling structure topology. The design of the coupling structure can be achieved by using topology optimization. By designing other types of coupling structures connected to the piezoceramic, we can obtain other types of flextensional actuators that produce high output displacements or forces in different directions, according to a specific application. Theorefore, in this paper, we propose a method for designing flextensional actuators by applying topology optimization technique based on the homogenization design method developed by Bends\o e and Kikuchi [2]. It consists of finding the optimal material distribution in a perforated structure with infinite microscale voids. The microscale voids are defined in each finite element subdomain by two dimensions and one orientation which are the design variables in the problem. The problem is posed as the design of a flexible structure coupled to the piezoceramic that maximizes the output displacement (or force) in some specified direction. Only static and low-frequency applications are considered. Although the method introduced is general and can be applied to the design of three-dimensional (3D) transducers, the examples presented herein are limited to two-dimensional (2D) models due to lower computational cost. Different types of actuators for different applications can be obtained.},

In particular, the setup with a thin superconducting film on a dielectric substrate, backed by a metallic endplate, is analysed. The results demonstrate that the effects of the substrate on the measured surface resistance of superconducting thin films must be taken into account. We show that in this setup several spurious effects are predicted. At characteristic frequencies, dependant on the substrate material, the commonly used thin-film approximation fails even for films thinner than the London penetration depth. In general, when the film is thicker than, but of the same order as, , the measured surface resistance can exceed both the thin-film and the bulk values. We investigate how the effective surface resistance of a superconducting film can be approximated by the bulk or the thin-film value, as a function of frequency, film and substrate thickness, and temperature. We exploit a thin-film model to take into account the effects of the backing materials. Measurements of surface resistance are performed on a BSCCO//metal structure to stress the nonintrinsic behaviours and to test the proposed model.},

However, the complex systems of lenses and filters required are bulky. Metamaterials can perform similar optical processing operations but with materials that need only be a wavelength thick. Silva et al. (p. 160; see the Perspective by Sihvola) present a simulation study that shows how an architecture based on such metamaterials can be designed to perform a suite of mathematical functions to create ultrathin optical signal and data processors. We introduce the concept of metamaterial analog computing, based on suitably designed metamaterial blocks that can perform mathematical operations (such as spatial differentiation, integration, or convolution) on the profile of an impinging wave as it propagates through these blocks. Two approaches are presented to achieve such functionality: (i) subwavelength structured metascreens combined with graded-index waveguides and (ii) multilayered slabs designed to achieve a desired spatial Green's function. Both techniques offer the possibility of miniaturized, potentially integrable, wave-based computing systems that are thinner than conventional lens-based optical signal and data processors by several orders of magnitude. An approach is described whereby metamaterials can be designed to perform a suite of mathematical functions.

  abstract = {Ferroelectric polarization is an intriguing physical phenomenon for tuning charge-transport properties and finds application in a wide range of optoelectronic devices. So far, ferroelectric materials in a planar geometry or chemically grown nanostructures have been used. However, these structural architectures possess serious disadvantages such as small surface areas and structural defects, respectively, leading to reduced performance. Herein, the growth of room-temperature ferroelectric nanoporous/nanocolumnar structure of Ag,Nb-codoped SrTiO3 (Ag/Nb:STO) using pulsed laser deposition is reported and demonstrated to have enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties using ferroelectric polarization. By manipulating the external electrical bias, {$\sim$}3-fold enhancement in the photocurrent from 40 to 130 {$\mu$}A{$\cdot$}cm-2 of film area is obtained. Concurrently, the flat-band potential is decreased from -0.55 to -1.13 V, revealing a giant ferroelectric tuning of the band alignment at the semiconductor surface and enhanced charge transfer. In addition, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study confirmed the tuning of the charge transfer with ferroelectric polarization. Our nanoporous ferroelectric-semiconductor approach offers a new platform with great potential for achieving highly efficient PEC devices for renewable energy applications.},

Cooling the metamaterial starting from 409 K down to 150 K causes about a 43\% shift in resonance frequency, and there is very little variation in resonance strength. The resonance shift is due to the temperature-dependent dielectric constant of the strontium titanate. The experiment opens up avenues for designing tunable terahertz devices by exploiting the temperature-sensitive characteristic of high dielectric constant substrates and complex metal oxide materials.},

Further, the quantum simulation is done within the framework of the quantum circuit model of computation. Our aim has been to address the design problem in electromagnetics\textemdash given an initial condition and a final field distribution, find the structures which satisfy these.

The multi-physics nature of the problem, coupling two disparate physical systems, brings both challenges and novel features not previously seen in so-called bifunctional metamaterials. In particular, by using an appropriately designed graded array of resonators, we show that it is possible to employ our metasurface to mode-convert sub-sonic surface flexural waves into bulk acoustic waves and vice-versa; transferring energy between two very different physical systems. Whilst the sub-sonic mechanical surface wave is dispersive, the bulk acoustic wave is dispersionless and radiates energy at infinity. We also show that this bifunctional metasurface is capable of exhibiting the classical effect of rainbow trapping for sub-sonic surface waves.},

The applied bias is then perpendicular to the layer and modifies the in-plane dielectric function, which is probed by the transverse terahertz wave. The observed tunable behavior is in agreement with the model of the ferroelectric soft mode behavior in SrTiO3 single crystals.

Interdigitated electrodes deposited on top of the structures allowed probing of the terahertz response upon an applied electric field. The phase transition into a ferroelectric state is observed in SrTiO3 films in all samples close to room temperature (between 250 and 310 K) due to in-plane epitaxial strain induced by the substrate and intercalated layers of DyScO3. Evolution of the dielectric spectra with temperature and external electric field is described by a general model which involves a damped harmonic oscillator (soft mode) coupled to a Debye relaxation (central mode). Both modes are connected with the soft mode eigenvector, as recently shown by molecular dynamics simulations, and they reflect a strong anharmonicity of the soft-mode potential. At high temperatures the soft-mode frequency variation drives all the changes observed in the spectra with temperature and applied field. At low temperatures, deep in the ferroelectric phase, the soft mode significantly hardens and loses its importance for the terahertz dynamics; the central mode becomes stronger and it almost completely determines the shape of the measured spectra. The observed variation of phase transition temperature and of the dielectric response among the structures is ascribed to a partial epitaxial strain relaxation confirmed also by x-ray diffraction.},

Furthermore, we consider the methods of sub-wavelength resolution THz imaging and the problem of THz wave delivery to hard to access tissues and internal organs.

Although strong absorption by water molecules prevents THz-waves from penetration of hydrated tissues and probing biological molecules in aqueous solutions, we discuss approaches for overcoming these drawbacks \textendash{} novel techniques of freezing and temporal dehydration by application of hyperosmotic agents which have a potential for cancer detection. We review recent applications of THz technology in diagnosis of malignancies and aiding histology paying particular attention to the origin of contrast observed between healthy and pathological tissues.

Modern modalities of THz imaging, which relies on the concepts of multi-spectral and multi-temporal domains and employing the principles of color vision, phase analysis and tomography are discussed. Novel methods of THz spectra analysis based on machine learning, pattern recognition, chemical imaging and the revealing of the spatial distribution of various substances in a tissue, are analyzed. Advanced thermal model describing biological object irradiated by THz waves and phantoms mimicking the optical properties of tissues at THz frequencies are presented. Finally, application of the high-resolution THz spectroscopy in analytic chemistry, biology and medicine are described.},

Auxetics are materials with a negative Poisson elastic parameter, meaning that they have a lateral extension, instead of shrinking, when they are stretched. The phonon dispersions obtained in the case of the auxetic model are compared with those of a conventional honeycomb network, where rigid rodlike particles are inserted. The behavior of the rotational dispersions can explain some experimental observations on the properties of sound propagation in the auxetic materials.},

  abstract = {Technological and scientific activities in the synthesis of ferroelectric thin films have been in progress for approximately 35 years with some very notable achievements taking place along the way. The work started with the simple evaporation of BaTiO3 by Feldman (1955), and accelerated during the 1970's with the advent of sputtering technologies. Since that time some totally new techniques and innovative processes have been introduced. The ability to routinely fabricate films having good ferroelectric properties in sub- micron thicknesses, and to demonstrate marketable products such as non-volatile memories and electro-optic switches has generated an immense interest in integrated ferroelectrics. Progress has been made in three areas: (1) theresearch and development of new processing technologies, (2) methods for accelerated testing and property measurement, and (3) the development of novel thin film devices utilizing the functional properties of ferroelectrics. Further advances in these areas are linked to an improved understanding of (1) the theory of nucleation and film growth related to composition, (2) the dependence of film properties on thickness, (3) concerns related to the compatibility of ferroelectrics with electrode materials, and (4) reliability issues.},

These are the modern technological antennas which are capable of analyzing the surrounding and perform necessary adjustment in order to attain and maintain maximum performance and these adjustments are performed by applying different technologies such as varactors, microelectromechanical systems (based on radio frequency), PIN diodes, and photoconductive plates. This kind of antenna is also capable of avoiding noise sources and capable of improvising to gain of the system and security due to their special properties, they consume less power and saves the energy by directing signals only toward the intended direction. Due to this phenomenal property of self-adjustment of with respect to the environments condition, reconfigurable antenna gets a wide-open field of operation in cognitive radios, satellite communications, multi-input multi-output systems (MIMO), and other various fields.},

The effective permittivity was discussed by using Effective Medium Approximation and Finite Element Method approaches. The role of porosity and specific microstructural characteristics induced by the pore forming addition, from closed porosity (0\textendash 3) towards a combined (0\textendash 3, 2\textendash 2) with lamellar-type of microstructures for the most porous ceramics was taken into consideration. All the investigated ceramics preserve a high level of tunability as in the dense material, irrespective of the porosity level, while the zero field permittivity was decreased to a few hundreds.},

Using the metal film and ion gel film as electrodes, the permittivity of the resonators can be adjusted by an external electric field and, as a result, the reflection phase of the resonators can be dynamically adjusted in a relatively wide range. By programmable controlling the electric field strength applied on resonators of metasurface, a 2{$\pi$} phase ramp can be realized and, thereby, the arbitrary reflection behavior of incident waves with varied frequency is obtained. Because of the tunability, this metasurface can also be used to design adaptive metasurface lens and carpet cloak.},

  abstract = {We present an analytical modeling framework and its analysis for thin piezoelectric metamaterial plates to enable and predict low-frequency bandgap formation in finite structural configurations with specified boundary conditions. Using Hamilton's extended principle and the assumptions of classical (Kirchhoff) plate theory, the governing equations and boundary conditions for the fully coupled two-dimensional electromechanical system are obtained. The two surfaces of the piezoelectric bimorph are segmented into non-overlapping opposing pairs of electrodes of arbitrary shape, and each pair of electrodes is shunted to an external circuit. This formulation can be used to study the effect of electrode shape on plate response for topology optimization and other vibration control applications. Using modal analysis, we show that for a sufficient number of electrodes distributed across the surface of the plate, the effective dynamic stiffness of the plate is determined by the shunt circuit admittance applied to each pair of electrodes and the system-level electromechanical coupling. This enables the creation of locally resonant bandgaps and broadband attenuation, among other effects, in analogy with our previous work for one-dimensional piezoelectric structures with synthetic impedance shunt circuits. It is also demonstrated that piezoelectric bimorph plates display significantly improved performance (i.e. electromechanical coupling) over bimorph beams, but require additional electrode segmentation to achieve metamaterial-type performance. The governing equations are also used for dispersion analysis using the plane wave expansion method, enabling the analytical dispersion analysis of unit cells with arbitrary electrode shapes. The modeling framework and approximate closed-form bandgap expressions are numerically validated using finite element analysis.},

We used the Ginzburg\textendash Landau kinetic equation to evaluate the evolution of polarization vectors. We also devised a polycrystal model with a core\textendash shell grain configuration to reflect the effect of the grain-boundary (GB) affected zone. The phase-field results showed that the coercive field tended to increase with frequency, but remnant polarization increased only slightly while the dielectric constant and piezoelectric constant d33, tended to decrease. We also found that, while both hysteresis and butterfly loops exhibited the familiar sharp tails at low frequencies, the tails disappeared and the loops became elliptic- and kidney-shaped, respectively, at high frequencies. The calculated low-frequency phenomena are widely supported by experiments, but the high-frequency ones are not commonly found in the literature. We substantiated both types of findings with details of the underlying domain dynamics. They clearly showed a complete 180\textdegree{} polarization reversal at low frequencies, but stopped mostly at 90\textdegree{} at high frequencies. We also examined the influence of the kinetic coefficient and the loading amplitude, and found that, as either increases, the elliptic and kidney shapes of the loops would occur at a higher frequency. The calculated grain-size effects indicated that the remnant polarization, dielectric constant, and d33 all decreased with decreasing grain size. This is again widely supported by experiments. But we also found that the grain-size effect of coercive field is more complicated. It may increase or decrease, and it is the magnitude of spontaneous polarization of the GB affected zone that determines its outcome.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents an evolutionary approach for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the TSP with backhauls (TSPB). We propose two evolutionary algorithms for solving the difficult TSPs. Our focus is on developing evolutionary operators based on conventional heuristics. We rely on a set of detailed computational experiments and statistical tests for developing an effective algorithm.The chapter starts with a careful survey of the algorithms for the TSP and the TSPB, with a special emphasis on crossover and mutation operators and applications on benchmark test instances. The second part addresses our first evolutionary algorithm. We explore the use of two tour construction heuristics, nearest neighbor and greedy, in developing new crossover operators.We focus on preserving the edges in the union graph constructed by edges of the parent tours.We let the heuristics exploit the building blocks found in this graph. This way, new solutions can inherit good blocks from both parents. We also combine the two crossover operators together in generating offspring to explore the potential gain due to synergy. In addition, we make use of 2-edge exchange moves as the mutation operator to incorporate more problem specific information in the evolution process. Our reproduction strategy is based on the generational approach. Experimental results indicate that our operators are promising in terms of both solution quality and computation time.In the third part of the chapter, we present the second evolutionary algorithm developed. This part can be thought of as an enhancement of the first algorithm. A common practice with such algorithms is to generate one child or two children from two parents. In the second implementation, we investigate the preservation of good edges available in more than two parents and generate multiple children.We use the steady-state evolution as a reproduction strategy this time and test the replacement of the worst parent or the worst population member to find the better replacement strategy. Our two mutation operators try to eliminate the longest and randomly selected edges and a third operator makes use of the cheapest insertion heuristic. The algorithm is finalized after conducting a set of experiments for best parameter settings and testing on larger TSPLIB instances. The second evolutionary algorithm is also implemented for solving randomly generated instances of the TSPB. Our experiments reveal that the algorithm is significantly better than the competitors in the literature. The last part concludes the chapter.},

Terahertz (THz) studies of molecular behavior in binary solutions present unique information on the picosecond motions of molecules. A complete mechanical interpretation of THz absorption spectra associated with solvated biomolecules remains a challenging task. The Gromacs molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package is used here to examine the spectral characteristics of water molecules in close proximity to biomolecules using vibrational density of states (VDOS). Systematic simulation of solvation dynamics of proteins of different size and tertiary structure are presented. The following have been selected for analysis. They range from less to more complex tertiary structure (corresponding to an increased number of secondary structure elements): TRP-cage13\textendash 20 peptide, TRP-cage, BPTI, and lysozyme. The initial study predicts that the depth of the hydration shell, determined by VDOS of water, extends to approximately 10 \AA{} and does not depend on protein size. Furthermore the integral perturbation coefficient of the whole solvation layer is found to be increased for larger proteins due to a higher retardation rate of water molecules in their shells. Differences in solvation dynamics among the proteins considered originate primarily from the water molecules buried in the interior of the protein and not from the on-surface molecules.},

Nevertheless, the point spread functions for single-molecule emission near metallic nanoparticles remain difficult to characterize due to fluorophore photodegradation, background emission and scattering from the plasmonic structure. Here we overcome this problem by exciting fluorophores remotely using plasmons propagating along metallic nanowires. The experiments reveal a complex array of single-molecule fluorescence point spread functions that depend not only on nanowire dimensions but also on the position and orientation of the molecular transition dipole. This work has consequences for both single-molecule regime-sensing and super-resolution imaging involving metallic nanoparticles and opens the possibilities for fast size sorting of metallic nanoparticles, and for predicting molecular orientation and binding position on metallic nanoparticles via far-field optical imaging.},

Finally, the samples were fixed in formalin to determine whether water was the sole source of image contrast in this study. We found that the cirrhotic tissue had a higher water content and absorption coefficient than the normal tissue and that even after formalin fixing there were significant differences between the normal and cirrhotic tissues' terahertz properties. Our results show that terahertz pulsed imaging can distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue due to differences in absorption originating from both water content and tissue structure.},

Although the approximation errors between the true function values and the approximation values are not small, the rough model can estimate the order relation of solutions with fair accuracy. By utilizing this nature of the rough model, we have proposed estimated comparison method, in which function evaluations are omitted when the order relation of solutions can be judged by approximation values. In the method, a parameter for error margin is introduced to avoid incorrect judgment. Also, a parameter for utilizing congestion of solutions is introduced to avoid omitting promising solutions. In order to improve the stability and efficiency of the method, we propose adaptive control of the margin parameter and the congestion parameter according to the success rate of the judgment. The advantage of these improvements is shown by comparing the results obtained by Differential Evolution (DE), DE with the estimated comparison method, adaptively controlled DE with the estimated comparison method and particle swarm optimization in various types of benchmark functions.},

The second is compatibility with the topology optimization method due to the similar domain representation and the sensitivity analysis. Structural shapes are represented by the phase field function defined in the design domain, and this function is optimized by solving a time-dependent reaction diffusion equation. The artificial double-well potential function used in the equation is derived from sensitivity analysis. We study four types of 2D or 2.5D (axisymmetric) optimization problems.

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.},

The chosen kinetic relations admit to account for differences in 90\textdegree - and 180\textdegree -domain wall motion and rate effects.

  abstract = {Here, a deep learning (DL) algorithm based on deep neural networks is proposed and employed to predict the chiroptical response of two-dimensional (2D) chiral metamaterials. Specifically, these 2D metamaterials contain nine types of left-handed nanostructure arrays, including U-like, T-like, and I-like shapes. Both the traditional rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method and DL approach are utilized to study the circular dichroism (CD) in higher-order diffraction beams. One common feature of these chiral metamaterials is that they all exhibit the weakest intensity but the strongest CD response in the third-order diffracted beams. Our work suggests that the DL model can predict CD performance of a 2D chiral nanostructure with a computational speed that is four orders of magnitude faster than RCWA but preserves high accuracy. The DL model\&\#x00A0;introduced in this work shows great potentials in exploring various chiroptical interactions in metamaterials and accelerating the design of hypersensitive photonic devices.},

We make use of a first-order homogenization approach, which replaces the discrete truss by an effective continuum description to be treated by finite elements in a macroscale boundary value problem. By defining the local truss architecture through a set of Bravais vectors, we formulate the optimization problem with regards to the spatially varying basis vectors and demonstrate its feasibility and performance through a series of benchmark problems in 2D (though the method is sufficiently general to also apply in 3D, as discussed). Both the displacement field and the topology are continuously varying unknown fields on the macroscale, and a regularization is included for well posedness. We argue that prior solutions obtained from aligning trusses along the directions of principal stresses are included as a special case. The outlined approach results in heterogeneous truss architectures with a smoothly varying unit cell, enabling easy fabrication with a tunable length scale (the latter avoiding the ill-posedness stemming from classical nonconvex methods without an intrinsic length scale).},

In accordance with the BCS model, the temperature peak disappears as the energy of incident radiation is increased above the gap. In non-zero field, the temperature behavior of transmission is modified because the gap is suppressed and vanishes at upper critical field. In addition, the presence of quantized vortices in the superconducting film substantially changes shape of the temperature curves.},

Although the structures are composed of two materials only, the dominant method used to tackle such a problem is to make the problem continuous through a relaxation of the binary constraint and to use a gradient-based approach. Global optimization algorithms working on continuous problems actually often fail to produce satisfying solutions in such a context characterized by a large number of parameters \textendash{} especially when space is discretized into a large number of pixels or voxels. However, we show here for three different photonics problems that global discrete optimization algorithms, which are adapted to this kind of problems, can provide efficient solutions which are relatively regular, physically understandable and close to being buildable. Such algorithms constitute overlooked but valuable tools for inverse design problems. Our preferred method is using a starting point provided by a gradient based algorithm, and run an optimization using Lengler's algorithm equipped with a simple smoothing operator to make the algorithm aware of the physical nature of the problem.},

However, these composites fall short of the toughness needed for permanent implants. Significant impediment to improvement has been the requisite use of conventional destructive mechanical testing, which is necessarily retrospective. Here we show quantitatively, through the novel use of calorimetry, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and neutron scattering, how GIC's developing fracture toughness during setting is related to interfacial THz dynamics, changing atomic cohesion and fluctuating interfacial configurations. Contrary to convention, we find setting is non-monotonic, characterized by abrupt features not previously detected, including a glass\textendash polymer coupling point, an early setting point, where decreasing toughness unexpectedly recovers, followed by stress-induced weakening of interfaces. Subsequently, toughness declines asymptotically to long-term fracture test values. We expect the insight afforded by these in situ non-destructive techniques will assist in raising understanding of the setting mechanisms and associated dynamics of cementitious materials.},

We show that the appearance of well-pronounced dips in the transmission spectra of a PCS is due to the interaction with resonant waveguide eigenmodes in the slab. The energy position and width of the dips in transmission provide information on the frequency and inverse radiative lifetime of the quasiguided eigenmodes. We calculate the energies, linewidths, and electromagnetic fields of such quasiguided eigenmodes, and analyze their symmetry and optical activity. The electromagnetic field in such modes is resonantly enhanced, which opens possibilities for use in creating resonant enhancement of different nonlinear effects.},

For a right-handed CLC coating, the boundary reflection switches the light polarization from left to right circular in the first loop and it switches in the second loop back to the left circular polarization before the emerging light finally escapes from the absorbing process. The enhancement of light absorption is possible in the frequency range as large as the photonic bang gap of the cholesteric layer, which can be adjusted as desired.},

In this review we focus on applying the PF method for material discovery. We start with a brief summary of the method, including numerical approaches for solving the PF equations. We then give seven examples of the application of the PF method for material discovery. We also discuss four barriers to its use for material discovery and provide approaches for how these barriers can be overcome. Finally, we detail four lessons that can be learned from the examples on how best to apply the PF method for material discovery.},

  abstract = {It has been shown numerically that systems of particles interacting with isotropic ``stealthy'' bounded long-ranged pair potentials (similar to Friedel oscillations) have classical ground states that are (counterintuitively) disordered, hyperuniform, and highly degenerate. Disordered hyperuniform systems have received attention recently because they are distinguishable exotic states of matter poised between a crystal and liquid that are endowed with novel thermodynamic and physical properties. The task of formulating an ensemble theory that yields analytical predictions for the structural characteristics and other properties of stealthy degenerate ground states in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd is highly nontrivial because the dimensionality of the configuration space depends on the number density {$\rho$} and there is a multitude of ways of sampling the ground-state manifold, each with its own probability measure for finding a particular ground-state configuration. The purpose of this paper is to take some initial steps in this direction. Specifically, we derive general exact relations for thermodynamic properties (energy, pressure, and isothermal compressibility) that apply to any ground-state ensemble as a function of {$\rho$} in any d, and we show how disordered degenerate ground states arise as part of the ground-state manifold. We also derive exact integral conditions that both the pair correlation function g2(r) and structure factor S(k) must obey for any d. We then specialize our results to the canonical ensemble (in the zero-temperature limit) by exploiting an ansatz that stealthy states behave remarkably like ``pseudo''-equilibrium hard-sphere systems in Fourier space. Our theoretical predictions for g2(r) and S(k) are in excellent agreement with computer simulations across the first three space dimensions. These results are used to obtain order metrics, local number variance, and nearest-neighbor functions across dimensions. We also derive accurate analytical formulas for the structure factor and thermal expansion coefficient for the excited states at sufficiently small temperatures for any d. The development of this theory provides new insights regarding our fundamental understanding of the nature and formation of low-temperature states of amorphous matter. Our work also offers challenges to experimentalists to synthesize stealthy ground states at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {Designing modern photonic devices often involves traversing a large parameter space via an optimization procedure, gradient based or otherwise, and typically results in the designer performing electromagnetic simulations of a large number of correlated devices. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of accelerating electromagnetic simulations using the data collected from such correlated simulations. In particular, we present an approach to accelerate the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) algorithm for the solution of frequency-domain Maxwell's equations using two machine learning models (principal component analysis and a convolutional neural network). These data-driven models are trained to predict a subspace within which the solution of the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations approximately lies. This subspace is then used for augmenting the Krylov subspace generated during the GMRES iterations, thus effectively reducing the size of the Krylov subspace and hence the number of iterations needed for solving Maxwell's equations. By training the proposed models on a dataset of wavelength-splitting gratings, we show an order of magnitude reduction (\textasciitilde 10\textendash 50) in the number of GMRES iterations required for solving frequency-domain Maxwell's equations.},

The technique makes use of Dispersive Quasi-Normal Modes (DQNMs), also known as natural modes of photonic structures, obtained by solving spectral problems associated to Maxwell's equations. The final expansion formula, based on a simple version of Keldysh's theorem, reveals the contributions of eigenmodes onto the scattered field, allowing us to understand the scattering properties of arbitrary shaped nanophotonic structures (bounded or unbounded), where permeability and permittivity can be dispersive, anisotropic, and even possibly nonreciprocal. This provides complete physical insights to the spectral characteristics of given structures as well as a transparent interpretation of numerical results.

Recent advances in reconfigurable and programmable metasurfaces have greatly extended their scope and reach into practical applications.

Motivated by these opportunities, this progress report provides a review of the recent advances in tunable and reconfigurable metasurfaces, highlighting the current challenges and outlining directions for future research. To better trace the historical evolution of tunable metasurfaces, a classification into globally and locally tunable metasurfaces is first provided along with the different physical addressing mechanisms utilized. Subsequently, coding metasurfaces, a particular class of locally tunable metasurfaces in which each unit cell can acquire discrete response states, is surveyed, since it is naturally suited to programmatic control. Finally, a new research direction of software-defined metasurfaces is described, which attempts to push metasurfaces toward unprecedented levels of functionality by harnessing the opportunities offered by their software interface as well as their inter- and intranetwork connectivity and establish them in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {The discovery of ferroelectricity marks its 100th anniversary this year ([ 1 ][1]), and this phenomenon continues to enrich our understanding of many fields of physics and material science, as well as creating subfields on its own. All of the ferroelectrics discovered have been limited to those exhibiting a polar space group of the bulk crystal that supports two or more topologically equivalent variants with different orientations of electric polarization. On pages 1458 and 1462 of this issue, Yasuda et al. ([ 2 ][2]) and Vizner Stern et al. ([ 3 ][3]), respectively, show that ferroelectricity can be engineered by artificially stacking a nonpolar in bulk, two-dimensional (2D) material, boron nitride (BN). A relatively weak van der Waals (vdW) coupling between the adjacent BN monolayers allows their parallel alignment in a metastable non-centrosymmetric coordination supporting 2D ferroelectricity with an out-of-plane electric polarization. These findings open opportunities to design 2D ferroelectrics out of parent nonpolar compounds. ![Figure][4]{$<$}/img{$>$} Polarization in hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN)GRAPHIC: C. BICKEL/ SCIENCE  Owing to the switchable electric polarization, ferroelectric materials are useful for various technological applications ([ 4 ][5]). A continuing quest for miniaturizing electronic devices inspires the search for appropriate materials exhibiting a reversible polarization at reduced dimensions. Although perovskite oxides have been widely used to explore ferroelectricity in thin-film structures and, in certain cases, showed promising results, they suffer from several limitations ([ 5 ][6]). Among them is the strong sensitivity of thin-film ferroelectricity to boundary conditions, largely resulting from the dangling bonds inherited from the perovskite structure, and oxygen stoichiometry, which is often not easy to control. The rise of vDW materials ([ 6 ][7]) opened opportunities for materials science, including studies of collective phenomena such as 2D ferroelectricity ([ 7 ][8]). 2D vdW ferroelectrics are appealing because of their uniform atomic thickness, absence of dangling bonds, and the ability to be integrated with other vdW materials, which allows for useful functionalities. For example, in combination with high-mobility materials such as graphene, the 2D vdW ferroelectrics can be employed in ferroelectric field-effect transistors or can be used as ultrathin barriers in ferroelectric tunnel junctions ([ 8 ][9]). Similar to perovskite oxides, however, the emergence of ferroelectricity in 2D vdW materials is limited by the requirement of the polar space group of the bulk crystal. In many-layered crystals, like hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) and transition-metal dichalcogenides, the polarization is prohibited by a centrosymmetric vdW structure that has lower energy than other stacking configurations. Yasuda et al. and Vizner Stern et al. remedy this limitation by showing that an intrinsically centrosymmetric vdW material, h -BN, can be engineered on the atomic scale to become ferroelectric. A bulk h -BN crystal has a layered structure where each BN monolayer displays a honeycomb coordination, similar to graphene, but with two interleaving sublattices composed of boron (B) and nitrogen (N). Bulk h -BN exhibits AA{${'}$} stacking (see the figure), where the top BN monolayer is 180\textdegree{} rotated with respect to the bottom so that the B (N) atoms are positioned atop the N (B) atoms, which makes the h -BN crystal centrosymmetric. A different BN coordination involves AA stacking, where two BN monolayers are stacked mirror symmetrically without rotation. This stacking is, however, unstable with respect to a B-N bond length displacement along the bond, which forms either AB or BA stacking configuration with half of the atoms lying atop each other and the other half facing empty centers of the hexagons ([ 9 ][10]). The AB and BA structures have broken inversion symmetry and exhibit an out-of-plane polarization, which can be qualitatively understood by the distortion of the 2pz orbital of the N atoms sitting atop B atoms ([ 10 ][11]). The AB and BA stackings are related by mirror reflection and hence have opposite polarizations. To realize AB (BA) stacked BN bilayers, an exfoliated BN monolayer was ripped off or few-monolayer h -BN flake were separated into two pieces, and then stamped them on top of each other with a precisely controlled twist angle. A zero-twist angle supports the AB (BA) stacking, whereas a small finite twist imposes interlayer translations forming a moir\'e pattern that consists of the three nearly commensurate stacking configurations AB, BA, and AA. Structural relaxation reconstructs this moir\'e pattern into large triangular domains of commensurate AB and BA stackings separated by abrupt incommensurate domain walls and topological AA defects that accommodate the global twist. The staggered polarization of the twisted BN was demonstrated by using piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) and Kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM). Both scanning probe methods revealed an array of triangular areas extending over several square micrometers and exhibiting an alternating contrast either in the piezoelectric response or in the electrostatic potential, thus indicating an opposite out-of-plane polarization of the AB and BA domains. The triangular contrast disappeared in a BN monolayer and AA{${'}$} stacked regions, confirming that the polarization is driven by the AB (BA) interlayer stacking. Notably, the authors showed that the spontaneous polarization can be switched by applied bias voltage. Yasuda et al. probed the polarization switching by measuring resistance of a graphene sheet deposited over a single AB (BA) domain to detect extra charge carriers induced by the BN-bilayer polarization. The forward and backward scans of the resistance versus gate voltage showed a pronounced hysteresis, indicating bistability driven by the polarization switching. In parallel, Vizner Stern et al. detected the polarization switching by scanning a biased tip above an individual AB (BA) domain. They observed redistribution of domain walls to orient the local polarization with the electric field under the biased tip. Scanning the same area with the tip of opposite polarity reversed the KPFM contract, indicating that polarization switching was fully reversible. The polarization switching was found to occur through the domain nucleation and growth mechanism reminiscent of that known to occur in perovskites oxides. However, whereas in perovskites the two polarization states are distinguished by the minute displacements of tightly bonded atoms, in the AB (BA) stacked BN, they differ by a double B-N bond length translation along a weakly coupled interface. As a result, the polarization reversal could be regarded as a lateral sliding of one BN monolayer with respect to the other occurring through domain-wall motion. Yasuda et al. and Vizner Stern et al. , along with recent work by Woods et al. ([ 11 ][12]) and Zheng et al. ([ 12 ][13]), identify synthetic ferroelectricity as an emergent field of research. These findings provide new opportunities for the fundamental studies of 2D ferroelectricity, as well as paving the way for innovative device applications. The proposed engineering of 2D ferroelectrics can be extended beyond BN to other vdW materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. The synthetic 2D ferroelectrics can be combined with other vdW materials to functionalize their electronic, spintronic, and optical responses. Overall, there are no doubts that this emergent field is rich in opportunities, and exciting new developments are to come. 1.  [{$\carriagereturn$}][14]1.   J. Valasek          , Phys.

  abstract = {Metal doped barium strontium titanate (BST; Ba0.5Sr0.5TixM1-xO3) nanopowders have been successfully synthesized through the oxalate precursor route based on low cost starting materials. The effect of metal ion substitution, namely Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+ and Y3+, on the crystal structure, microstructure and optical, electrical, dielectric and magnetic properties of BST was studied. The results revealed that a crystalline single cubic BST phase was formed for pure and Mn2+, Co2+ and Y3+ ion-substituted BST samples, whereas a tetragonal BST structure was obtained for the Fe3+ substituted BST sample at an annealing temperature of 1000 \textdegree C for 2 h. Furthermore, addition of the metal ions was found to decrease the crystallite size and unit cell volume of the produced BST phase. The microstructure of the produced pure BST phase was metal ion dependent. Most BST particles appeared as a cubic like structure. The transparency of BST was found to increase with metal substitution. Meanwhile, the band gap energy was increased from 3.4 eV for pure BST to 3.8, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 eV as the result of substitution by Fe3+, Mn2+ and Co2+ and Y3+ ions, respectively. The DC resistivity was metal ion dependent. The highest DC resistivity ({$\rho$} = 66.60 \texttimes{} 105 {$\Omega$} cm) was accomplished with the Mn2+ ion. Moreover, the addition of metal ions decreased the dielectric properties of the expected Mn2+ ion and increased the magnetic properties.},

  abstract = {Metamaterials are being applied to the development and construction of many new devices throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Limitations posed by the metamaterial operational bandwidth and losses can be effectively mitigated through the incorporation of tunable elements into the metamaterial devices. There are a wide range of approaches that have been advanced in the literature for adding reconfiguration to metamaterial devices all the way from the RF through the optical regimes, but some techniques are useful only for certain wavelength bands. A range of tuning techniques span from active circuit elements introduced into the resonant conductive metamaterial geometries to constituent materials that change electromagnetic properties under specific environmental stimuli. This paper presents a survey of the development of reconfigurable and tunable metamaterial technology as well as of the applications where such capabilities are valuable.},

  abstract = {Real collective density variables C(k) [cf. Eq. (1.3)] in many-particle systems arise from nonlinear transformations of particle positions, and determine the structure factor S(k), where k denotes the wave vector. Our objective is to prescribe C(k) and then to find many-particle configurations that correspond to such a target C(k) using a numerical optimization technique. Numerical results reported here extend earlier one- and two-dimensional studies to include three dimensions. In addition, they demonstrate the capacity to control S(k) in the neighborhood of {$\mid$}k{$\mid$}=0. The optimization method employed generates multiparticle configurations for which S(k){$\propto\mid$}k{$\mid\alpha$}, {$\mid$}k{$\mid\leqslant$}K, and {$\alpha$}=1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The case {$\alpha$}=1 is relevant for the Harrison-Zeldovich model of the early universe, for superfluid 4He, and for jammed amorphous sphere packings. The analysis also provides specific examples of interaction potentials whose classical ground states are configurationally degenerate and disordered.},

  abstract = {Collective density variables {$\rho$}(k) have proved to be useful tools in the study of many-body problems in a variety of fields that are concerned with structural and kinematic phenomena. In spite of their broad applicability, mathematical understanding of collective density variables remains an underexplored subject. In this paper, we examine features associated with collective density variables in two dimensions using numerical exploration techniques to generate particle patterns in the classical ground state. Particle pair interactions are governed by a continuous, bounded potential. Our approach involves constraining related collective parameters C(k), with wave vector k magnitudes at or below a chosen cutoff, to their absolute minimum values. Density fluctuations for those k's thus are suppressed. The resulting investigation distinguishes three structural regimes as the number of constrained wave vectors is increased\textemdash disordered, wavy crystalline, and crystalline regimes\textemdash each with characteristic distinguishing features. It should be noted that our choice of pair potential can lead to pair correlation functions that exhibit an effective hard core and thus signal the formation of a hard-disk-like equilibrium fluid. In addition, our method creates particle patterns that are hyperuniform, thus supporting the notion that structural glasses can be hyperuniform as the temperature T\textrightarrow 0.},

  abstract = {With the necessary transition to renewable energy at hand, there is a renewed research focus on increasing solar cell efficiency in order to reduce the cost of electricity. Nanomaterials are promising candidates to contribute to a new generation of low cost and highly efficient solar cells. Due to their wavelength-scale dimensions, nanomaterials display exceptionally strong light\textendash matter interactions that lead to large perturbations in absorption and emission compared to their bulk counterparts. Although most work on nanostructured solar cells has focused on increasing the absorption, emission control may have even greater potential for improving efficiency of state-of-the-art solar cells. In this Perspective, we describe how nanostructures can be applied to improve solar cell efficiency, focusing on emission control. First, we analyze the requirements for making the most efficient solar cell by looking at the thermodynamics of energy conversion. We show that an ideal solar cell at open circuit displays emission that is identical to its absorption. Comparing this to the emission of a typical silicon solar cell shows that there are three differences: the intensity, the angles in which light is emitted, and the spectrum. These differences lead to a reduction in efficiency, mainly due to a drop in open circuit voltage. For each loss mechanism, we discuss how nanomaterials can manipulate the emission and thereby reduce the voltage loss. Finally, we analyze the performance of two conceptual designs for solar cells based on nanomaterials. These give a large improvement in efficiency compared to conventional designs, showing the great potential of nanomaterials in solar cells.},

Room temperature pulsed laser deposition of a uniform layer of lead titanate on top of these nanorod arrays and subsequent heating to 565 \textdegree C, far above the degradation temperature of the block copolymer nanorods, resulted in ordered arrays of ferroelectric lead titanate nanoparticles, due to the evaporation of the polymer rods and the SrTiO3 substrate-nucleated crystallization of the lead titanate. The spacing in between the ordered cylinders of the template and the nonselective nature of the coating procedure sets the method apart from conventional block copolymer templating techniques involving parallel cylindrical structures. Given the nonselective nature of the coating method, this template procedure is applicable for a large variety of inorganics.},

At this particular stage, an insufficient consideration for uncertainty could lead to a wrong decision on the feasibility of the mission. Contrary to the traditional margin approach, the methodology presented here explicitly introduces uncertainties in the design process. The overall system design is then optimised, minimising the impact of uncertainties on the optimal value of the design criteria. Evidence Theory, used as the framework to model uncertainties, is presented in details. Although its use in the design process would greatly improve the quality of the design, it increases significantly the computational cost of any multidisciplinary optimisation. Therefore, two approaches to tackle an Optimisation Problem Under Uncertainties are proposed: (a) a direct solution through a multi-objective optimisation algorithm and (b) an indirect solution through a clustering algorithm. Both methods are presented, highlighting the techniques used to reduce the computational time. It will be shown in particular that the indirect method is an attractive alternative when the complexity of the problem increases.},

In contrast to the existing interpretation of these theories as versions of the non-classical shear deformable plate theory, an attempt is made to demonstrate that, under proper transformation, the sixth-order theory can be qualified as a modern form of the classical plate theory. To support this conception, physical inconsistency of the existing fourth-order classical plate theory is demonstrated, while equations of the sixth-order theory are derived in a traditional straightforward way not requiring variational calculus and providing the plate theory consistent from both mathematical and physical standpoints. Analysis and examples are presented to show that both the biharmonic equation to which Kirchhoff plate theory is reduced and the second-order boundary layer equation derived by Reissner are non-separable parts of one and the same theory that is proposed to be referred to as the classical plate theory.},

  abstract = {In the optimization of a piezocomposite, the objective is to obtain an improvement in its performance characteristics, usually by changing the volume fractions of constituent materials, its properties, shape of inclusions, and mechanical properties of the polymer matrix (in the composite unit cell). Thus, this work proposes a methodology, based on topology optimization and homogenization, to design functionally graded piezocomposite materials that considers important aspects in the design process aiming at energy harvesting applications, such as the influence of piezoelectric polarization directions and the influence of material gradation. The influence of the piezoelectric polarization direction is quantitatively verified using the Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) method, which combines gradients with mathematical programming to solve a discrete optimization problem. The homogenization method is implemented using the graded finite element concept, which takes into account the continuous gradation inside the finite elements. One of the main questions answered in this work is, quantitatively, how the microscopic stresses can be reduced by combining the functionally graded material (FGM) concept with optimization. In addition, the influence of polygonal elements is investigated, quantitatively, when compared to quadrilateral 4-node finite element meshes, which are usually adopted in material design. However, quads exhibit one-node connections and are susceptible to checkerboard patterns in topology optimization applications. To circumvent these problems, Voronoi diagrams are used as an effective means of generating irregular polygonal meshes for piezocomposite design. The present results consist of bi-dimensional unit cells that illustrate the methodology proposed in this work.},

In this work, we optimize the slow light dispersion relation of a photonic crystal waveguide with three dimensional (3D) inverse design methods.

Here, we solve these challenges with photonic inverse design and experimentally demonstrate a slow-light PCW optical phased array (OPA) with a wide steering range. Even and odd mode PCWs are engineered for a group index of 25, over a bandwidth of 20 and 12 nm, respectively.

The effect of volume fraction, losses, and biasing field on homogenized properties is investigated and the analysis of the photonic band diagram is carried out, providing the frequency dependence of the anisotropic effective index and tunability.

These structures can be used as resonant reflection bandcut spectral filters that are independent of the polarization and direction of incidence. We show that this resonant reflection dip is due to the excitation of quasimodes (modes associated with a complex frequency) leading to quasi-total absorption. We have fabricated large area samples made of chromium nanorod gratings on top of Si/Cr layers deposited on silicon substrate. Measurements by Fourier transform spectrophotometry show good agreement with finite element simulations. A quasimodal expansion method is applied to obtain a minimal resonant model that fits well full wave simulations and that highlights excitation conditions of the modes.},

The underlying free energy function of the phase-field model stems from a completely knowledge-based multiscale adjustment approach (V\"olker et al 2011 Contin. Mech. Thermodyn. 23 435\textendash 451) and is based on results from atomistic DFT calculations and SMP simulations. We address the question of whether phase-field models in such a multiscale simulation approach are capable of yielding reasonable values for the coercive electric field strength, i.e. the electric fields necessary to initiate irreversible switching processes in the domain structure, causing the experimentally observed hysteresis behavior of ferroelectrics. Therefore, a variety of typical ferroelectric bulk domain structures are taken into account and studied regarding their large-signal behavior. Trends are shown in the correlation between the complexity of the domain structure and the coercive field strength predicted by the phase-field model. The role of imperfections in the material such as charged defects and grain boundaries is of special interest, since they act as nucleation centers for new domains under electric loading. In this way, they reduce significantly the coercive field strength from the value given by the energy barrier in the free energy to magnitudes close to or of the order observed in experiments on polycrystalline ferroelectrics.},

A recently presented routine (V\"olker et al 2011 Contin. Mech. Thermodyn. 23 435\textendash 51) for adjusting the Helmholtz free energy coefficients to intrinsic and extrinsic ferroelectric material properties obtained by DFT calculations and atomistic simulations was subject to certain limitations: caused by too small available degrees of freedom, an independent adjustment of the spontaneous strains and piezoelectric coefficients was not possible, and the elastic properties could only be considered in cubic instead of tetragonal symmetry. In this work we overcome such restrictions by expanding the formulation of the free energy function, i.e. by motivating and introducing new higher-order terms that have not appeared in the literature before. Subsequently we present an improved version of the adjustment procedure for the free energy coefficients that is solely based on input parameters from first-principles calculations performed by Marton and Els\"asser, as documented in V\"olker et al (2011 Contin. Mech. Thermodyn. 23 435\textendash 51). Full sets of adjusted free energy coefficients for PbTiO3 and tetragonal Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 are presented, and the benefits of the newly introduced higher-order free energy terms are discussed.},

We employ the homogenized model of such medium to compute intervals \textemdash{} band gaps \textemdash{} of the incident wave frequencies for which acoustic waves cannot propagate. It was demonstrated that the band gaps distribution can be influenced by changing the shape of inclusions. Therefore, we deal with the shape optimization problem to maximize low-frequency band gaps; their bounds are determined by analysing the effective mass tensor of the homogenized medium. Analytic transformation formulas are derived which describe dispersion effects of resizing the inclusions. The core of the problem lies in sensitivity of the eigenvalue problem associated with the microstructure. Computational sensitivity analysis is developed, which allows for efficient usage of the gradient based optimization methods. Numerical examples with 2D structures are reported to illustrate the effects of optimization with stiffness constraint. This study is aimed to develop modelling tools which can be used in optimal design of new acoustic devices for ``smart systems''.},

In many cases, such as stress optimization, where details at the boundaries are crucially important, the filtering in the vicinity of the design domain boundary needs special attention. One well-known technique, often referred to as ``padding,'' is to extend the design domain with extra layers of elements to mitigate artificial boundary effects. We discuss an alternative to the padding procedure in the context of PDE filtering. To motivate this augmented PDE filter, we make use of the potential form of the PDE filter which allows us to add penalty terms with a clear physical interpretation. The major advantages of the proposed augmentation compared with the conventional padding is the simplicity of the implementation and the possibility to tune the boundary properties using a scalar parameter. Analytical results in 1D and numerical results in 2D and 3D confirm the suitability of this approach for large-scale topology optimization.},

Owing to its intrinsic capability to accurately resolve discontinuities, BMM avoids the notorious problems of FMM that are associated with the Gibbs phenomenon. As a result, BMM facilitates significantly more efficient eigenmode computations. With regard to BMM-based transmission and reflection computations, it is demonstrated that a novel Galerkin approach (in conjunction with a scattering-matrix algorithm) allows for an improved field matching between different layers. This approach is superior relative to the traditional point-wise field matching. Moreover, only this novel Galerkin approach allows for an competitive extension of BMM to the case of two-dimensional diffraction gratings. These improvements will be very useful for high-accuracy grating computations in general and for the analysis of associated electromagnetic field profiles in particular.},

Recently, particular interest was raised in finite size ferroelectrics because of the increasingly important role they play in the development of ultra-high density non-volatile ferroelectric random access memories (FRAMs). Meanwhile, the properties of a ferroelectric material, such as spontaneous polarization and Curie temperature, are well known to depend on many factors, including sample dimensions, ambient temperature, external mechanical loads, surface effects and electrostatic boundary conditions (Rabe et al., 2007; Landau et al., 1960; Junquera and Ghosez, 2003; Tybell et al., 1999; Zhong et al., 1994a; 1994b; Zembilgotov et al., 2002; Wang et al., 1995; Li et al., 1997; Lupascu, 2004; Wang and Woo, 2005; Lines and Glass, 1977). Since ferroelectricity is a collective phenomenon, it was believed for a long time that the effects of finite size would play an important role in the properties of ferroelectrics, such as polarization, dielectric constants and Curie temperature. Many theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in the last few decades.},

Phase-change materials are uniquely suited to enable their creation as they offer high-speed electrical switching between amorphous and crystalline states with notably different optical properties. Their high refractive index has already been harnessed to fashion them into compact optical antennas. Here, we take the next important step, by showing electrically-switchable phase-change antennas and metasurfaces that offer strong, reversible, non-volatile, multi-phase switching and spectral tuning of light scattering in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges. Their successful implementation relies on a careful joint thermal and optical optimization of the antenna elements that comprise a silver strip that simultaneously serves as a plasmonic resonator and a miniature heating stage.

The deformation of the Miura-ori unit along the third dimension induces net electric and magnetic dipoles of split-ring resonators parallel or anti-parallel to each other, leading to the strong chiral responses. Circular dichroism as high as 0.6 is experimentally observed while the chirality switching is realized by controlling the deformation direction and kinematics. In addition, the relative density of the origami metamaterials can be dramatically reduced to only 2\% of that of the unfolded structure.

The temporal evolution of the polarization switching shows that the switching is a process of nucleation, if needed, and growth of energy-favorite domains. Macroscopic polarization and strain are obtained by averaging polarizations and strains over the entire simulated ferroelectric. The simulation results successfully reveal the hysteresis loop of macroscopic polarization versus the applied electric field, the butterfly curve of macroscopic strain versus the applied electric field, and the macroscopically nonlinear strain response to applied compressive stresses.},

It is employed to determine the temperature\textendash shape (aspect ratio) phase diagram, domain structures, and domain switching of PbTiO3 nanoparticles using phase field simulations. It is shown that the Curie temperature is enhanced for nanowires and nanorods and reduced for nanodots. The critical sizes below which the ferroelectricity disappears for the nanowire and thin film are estimated to be around 1.4nm. Vortex domain structures are found in nanorods, nanodots, and nanodisks. Results are in general agreement with existing experimental observations and first principle calculations.},

A fabricated prototype demonstrates this method in a reconfigurable antenna application in which EGaIn forms the radiating element. By inducing a change in the physical length of the EGaIn, the operating frequency of the antenna tunes over a large bandwidth. This purely electrochemical mechanism uses low, DC voltages to tune the antenna continuously and reversibly between 0.66\,GHz and 3.4\,GHz resulting in a 5:1 tuning range. Gain and radiation pattern measurements agree with electromagnetic simulations of the device, and its measured radiation efficiency varies from 41\% to 70\% over its tuning range.},

We show that the TM modes in a gyromagnetic photonic crystal can be formally mapped to electronic wave functions in a periodic electromagnetic field, so that the only requirement for the existence of one-way edge modes is that the Chern number for all bands below a gap is nonzero. In a square-lattice yttrium-iron-garnet crystal operating at microwave frequencies, which lacks Dirac points, time-reversal breaking is strong enough that the effect should be easily observable. For realistic material parameters, the edge modes occupy a 10\% band gap. Numerical simulations of a one-way waveguide incorporating this crystal show 100\% transmission across strong defects.},

Among them, the skin is primarily investigated due to the short penetration depth of THz waves caused by the high attenuation by water in biological samples. However, a complete model of skin describing the THz\textendash skin interaction is still needed. This is also fundamental to reveal the optical properties of the skin from the measured THz spectrum. It is crucial that the correct model is used, not just to ensure compatibility between different works, but more importantly to ensure the reliability of the data and conclusions. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the models applied to skin used in the THz regime, and we compare their adaptability, accuracy, and limitations. We show that most of the models attempt to extract the hydration profile inside the skin while there is also the anisotropic model that displays skin structural changes in the stratum corneum.},

This paper proposes a new topological shape optimization method for systematic computational design of a type of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials), which integrates the numerical homogenization approach into a powerful parametric level set method (PLSM). The homogenization method is used to obtain the effective properties of the periodic microstructure, while the PLSM is applied to achieve shape evolutions and topological changes of the microstructure, until the desired material properties are achieved. The key concept of the PLSM is the interpolation of the implicit level set surface by using a given set of compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBF), which are positioned at a number of given and fixed knots inside the design domain. Several typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the favorable characteristics of the proposed method in the design of micro-structured metamaterials.},

Using this proposed algorithm, the experimentally measured effective thermal conductivities of domain-engineered \{001\}p-BiFeO3 thin films are quantitatively reproduced. In conjunction with two other testing examples, this proposed algorithm is proven to be an efficient tool for interpreting the relationship between the effective thermal conductivity and micro-/domain-structures. By combining this algorithm with the phase-field model of ferroelectric thin films, the effective thermal conductivity for PbZr1-xTixO3 films under different composition, thickness, strain, and working conditions is predicted. It is shown that the chemical composition, misfit strain, film thickness, film orientation, and a Piezoresponse Force Microscopy tip can be used to engineer the domain structures and tune the effective thermal conductivity. Therefore, we expect our findings will stimulate future theoretical, experimental and engineering efforts on developing devices based on the tunable effective thermal conductivity in ferroelectric nanostructures.},

Herein, we demonstrate a direct and universal method based on the finite element method to calculate the Chern number of the typical topological photonic crystals by dividing the Brillouin zone into small zones, establishing new properties to obtain the discrete Chern number, and simultaneously drawing the Berry curvature of the first Brillouin zone. We also explore the manner in which the topological properties are influenced by the different structure types, air duty ratios, and rotating operations of the unit cells; meanwhile, we obtain large Chern numbers from\textendash 2 to 4. Furthermore, we can tune the topological phase change via different rotation operations of triangular dielectric pillars. This study provides a highly efficient and simple method for calculating the Chern numbers and plays a major role in the prediction of novel topological photonic states.},

Recent technological progress in developing THz instrumentation, means that commercial THz systems are being produced with improving performance which are easier to operate and more reliable. THz phase imaging, an advanced imaging technology which combines the benefits of THz and commonly used phase imaging techniques, has recently received significant attention. In this paper, the current state of such imaging systems is reviewed. This review deals with both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) imaging systems. Pulsed THz phase imaging is a coherent measurement, which includes terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) based on femtosecond laser and holographic imaging in the time domain, both allow phase and amplitude information of the electric field to be recorded. CW THz phase imaging is mainly based on digital holography, interferometry and ptychography. These systems can obtain the complex amplitude by capturing diffraction patterns and applying numerical reconstruction techniques. Biomedical applications of such THz systems are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is a popular numerical modelling technique in computational electromagnetics. The volumetric nature of the FDTD technique means simulations often require extensive computational resources (both processing time and memory). The simulation of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is one such challenge, where the GPR transducer, subsurface/structure, and targets must all be included in the model, and must all be adequately discretised. Additionally, forward simulations of GPR can necessitate hundreds of models with different geometries (A-scans) to be executed. This is exacerbated by an order of magnitude when solving the inverse GPR problem or when using forward models to train machine learning algorithms. We have developed one of the first open source GPU-accelerated FDTD solvers specifically focused on modelling GPR. We designed optimal kernels for GPU execution using NVIDIA's CUDA framework. Our GPU solver achieved performance throughputs of up to 1194 Mcells/s and 3405 Mcells/s on NVIDIA Kepler and Pascal architectures, respectively. This is up to 30 times faster than the parallelised (OpenMP) CPU solver can achieve on a commonly-used desktop CPU (Intel Core i7-4790K). We found the cost\textendash performance benefit of the NVIDIA GeForce-series Pascal-based GPUs \textendash{} targeted towards the gaming market \textendash{} to be especially notable, potentially allowing many individuals to benefit from this work using commodity workstations. We also note that the equivalent Tesla-series P100 GPU \textendash{} targeted towards data-centre usage \textendash{} demonstrates significant overall performance advantages due to its use of high-bandwidth memory. The performance benefits of our GPU-accelerated solver were demonstrated in a GPR environment by running a large-scale, realistic (including dispersive media, rough surface topography, and detailed antenna model) simulation of a buried anti-personnel landmine scenario.

The Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used for the simulation. We measured the gain and directivity of antennas with and without a superstrate and found that the gain of a single BST array antenna with a superstrate was enhanced by about 2 dBi of directivity and 3 dB of gain over the one without a superstrate at 2.3 GHz. The impedance bandwidths of a single patch with and without a superstrate for VSWR {$<$}; 2 were in the Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) application range which is 2.3 GHz to 2.5 GHz. Compared with the BST elements array antenna with the same aperture size but without the dielectric superstrate, the performance of the antenna is improved obviously and the design is suitable for array applications for example base station.},

  abstract = {A topological paradigm shift The discovery of topological phases of matter forced condensed matter physicists to question and reexamine some of the basic notions of their discipline. Wen reviews the progress of the field that took a sharp turn from Landau's broken symmetry paradigm to arrive at the modern notions of topological order and quantum entanglement in many-body systems. This development was made possible by using increasingly sophisticated mathematical formalisms. Science, this issue p. eaal3099 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDOur world is very rich. One aspect of its richness is reflected in the existence of many different phases of matter. More than half a century ago, Landau developed a theory to describe phases of matter on the basis of symmetry breaking. He pointed out that the distinction between different phases stems from the way their constituent particles are organized (ordered); different phases correspond to different symmetries of the particles' ordering. For many years, it was widely believed that the symmetry-breaking theory described all phases and all phase transitions. ADVANCESHowever, the study of chiral spin liquids and quantum Hall (QH) liquids eventually revealed phases of matter and organizations of particles not described by the symmetry-breaking theory. This new kind of order was referred to as topological order, because it is closely related to the topological quantum field theory introduced by Witten in 1989.It took researchers 20 years to realize that topological order is nothing but the patterns of quantum entanglement in many-body systems, which can be intuitively understood via two analogies to dancing: (i) Dance of particles (or step dance). Particles move in a spiral fashion and take a fixed number of steps to dance around each other. (ii) Dance of strings. The local degrees of freedom form strings that join in a particular way (see the figure). The strings can dance by moving around and reconnecting freely.The first type of dance, the step dance, describes topological order in chiral spin liquids and QH liquids, whereas the string dance describes topological order in other spin liquids. The QH liquids have been realized by electron systems at the interface of semiconductors and by graphene, under strong magnetic fields. The topological order categorized by the string dance may be realized by electron spins in certain materials, such as herbertsmithite and RuCl3.In the string-net liquids described by the string dance, the strings can be viewed as the ``electric'' flux of a gauge theory, and the string density wave give rise to an emergent (non-Abelian) gauge field. The ends of the strings are topological excitations that may carry fractional charges, fractional (non-Abelian) statistics in two-dimensional (2D) systems, and Fermi statistics in 3D systems. The QH liquids categorized by the step dance also have emergent gauge theory\textemdash the Chern-Simons gauge theory. This type of dance leads to indestructible perfect conducting boundaries, as well as indestructible qubits (units of quantum information). Topologically ordered states are materials with intriguing properties, which may be useful in electronic devices and topological quantum computation. OUTLOOKThe emergence of topological phases of matter from the patterns of many-body quantum entanglement is a truly new phenomenon. New mathematics is needed to describe and classify topological orders. Recent studies have revealed that a unitary modular tensor category is required to classify 2D bosonic topological orders, and unitary braided fusion categories are necessary to classify 2D fermionic topological orders. To classify 2D topological orders with symmetry G, a G-cross unitary modular tensor category (for bosons) or a unitary braided fusion categories over Rep(G) (for bosons and fermions) is needed. However, the mathematical theory, including higher-category theory, to classify topological orders in three dimensions and beyond is still evolving.Many-body entanglement is not only the origin of many new states of quantum matter (such as topological orders), it is also the origin of emergent gauge fields, as well as emergent Fermi or fractional statistics, from the simple bosonic qubits that form the system. Recent work has indicated that our empty space itself might be a system formed by many qubits\textemdash a qubit ocean. In other words, the space itself is formed by entangled qubits; if there is no qubit, there is no sense of space. The entanglement of the qubits provides a sense of neighborhood and dimension of the space. If the quantum entanglement of the qubits in the ocean is described by a particular string-net dance, then the string density waves in the string-net liquid generate electromagnetic waves that satisfy the Maxwell equation and gluon waves that satisfy the Yang-Mills equation. String ends produce electrons and quarks that carry Fermi statistics and satisfy the Dirac equation. Those emergent gauge fields and fermions are the elementary particles in the standard model. Such an emergence picture based on string-nets represents a unification of matter and information (see the figure). {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6429/eaal3099/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint String-nets.Local degrees of freedom form strings (colored lines), which can then join in a specific way to create a string-net. Sting-net liquids can give rise to emergent (non-Abelian) gauge theory, emergent fractional or non-Abelian statistics (in 2+1D), and emergent fermions (in 3+1D). This concept unifies gauge interaction and Fermi statistics and provides a cohesive origin for light and electrons, as well as other elementary particles. It has long been thought that all different phases of matter arise from symmetry breaking. Without symmetry breaking, there would be no pattern, and matter would be featureless. However, it is now clear that for quantum matter at zero temperature, even symmetric disordered liquids can have features, giving rise to topological phases of quantum matter. Some of the topological phases are highly entangled (that is, have topological order), whereas others are weakly entangled (that is, have symmetry-protected trivial order). This Review provides a brief summary of these zero-temperature states of matter and their emergent properties, as well as their importance in unifying some of the most basic concepts in nature.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric perovskite materials have been shown to exhibit a large electrocaloric effect near phase transitions. We develop a computational model based on a phase-field approach to characterize the structure of ferroelectric to paraelectric phase boundaries for planar configurations under generalized plane strain with temperatures near the Curie temperature. A nonlinear finite element method is used to solve for the phase boundary structure of a representative unit cell with a 180\textdegree{} ferroelectric laminate for a range of domain widths. The temperature at which the phase boundary can be found increases with domain width, approaching the Curie temperature asymptotically. The excess free energy density per unit area of the boundary increases with domain width. As expected, closure domains form between the ferroelectric and paraelectric phase, and the shape of the closure domains evolves from triangular to needle-shaped as the domain width increases. The entropy jump across the phase boundary is quantified and is shown to increase with domain width as well. A planar configuration with a 90\textdegree{} ferroelectric laminate is investigated, but shown to be physically unlikely due to the high stress levels required to achieve strain compatibility between the phases. Possible three-dimensional structures of the ferroelectric\textendash paraelectric phase boundary are also discussed.},

This problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems and lots of research works have been performed to develop a practical and efficient heuristic algorithm. This chapter surveys up-to-date research efforts to address the reliable network design problem and proposes a new hybrid heuristic of the genetic algorithm and local search ant colony system. The proposed hybrid heuristic represents a twoedge- connected candidate network as multiple rings. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of multi-ring-encoded individuals with special genetic operators while the local search ant colony system fine-tunes each ring. The results of computer experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid heuristic.},

Here we study the two most simple VEM elements suitable for Kirchhoff-Love plates as stated in Brezzi and Marini (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 253:455\textendash 462, 2013). The formulation contains new ideas and different approaches for the stabilisation needed in a virtual element, including classic and energy stabilisations. An efficient stabilisation is crucial in the case of \$\$C\^1\$\$-continuous elements because the rank deficiency of the stiffness matrix associated to the projected part of the ansatz function is larger than for \$\$C\^0\$\$-continuous elements. This paper aims at providing engineering inside in how to construct simple and efficient virtual plate elements for isotropic and anisotropic materials and at comparing different possibilities for the stabilisation. Different examples and convergence studies discuss and demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting VEM elements. Finally, reduction of virtual plate elements to triangular and quadrilateral elements with 3 and 4 nodes, respectively, yields finite element like plate elements. It will be shown that these \$\$C\^1\$\$-continuous elements can be easily incorporated in legacy codes and demonstrate an efficiency and accuracy that is much higher than provided by traditional finite elements for thin plates.},

The recently developed metamaterials are a potential choice for biosensing due to their exotic properties. In the current work, a label-free and specific sensor for streptavidin\textendash agarose (SA) was fabricated based on terahertz metamaterial functionlized by octadecanthiols and biotins. Both low and high frequency resonant modes from the metamaterials are found applicable for the detection of SA, and a redshift up to 6.76GHz for the high frequency mode was measured in the undiluted commercial solution. The low frequency mode is attributed to inductor\textendash capacitor (LC) oscillation, while the high frequency mode originates from the plasmonic dipole oscillator, both of which are highly sensitive to the micro-environment change. Adsorption of SA of different concentrations causes different redshifts, and the replacement of high refractive-index substrate with low refractive-index substrate can efficiently promote the sensitivity, well agreeing with the numerical simulation. Moreover, for a particular biomolecule, the sensitivity can be further improved by optimizing the metamaterial design. This method might be very helpful for desirable biorecognition in biology, medicine, and drug industry.},

In particular, understanding the role of distributions of ordered and disordered particles in a host media is scientifically and technologically important for designing novel materials and devices with superior spectral and angular properties. In this work, the effective medium property of disordered composite materials consisting of hyperuniformly distributed hard particles at different filling fractions is investigated. To accurately extract effective permittivity of a disordered composite material, a full-wave finite element method and the transmission line theory are used. Numerical results show that the theory of hyperuniformity can be conveniently used to design disordered composite materials with good accuracy compared with those materials with randomly dispersed particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a Luneburg lens based on the proposed hyperuniform media has superior radiation properties in comparison with previously reported metamaterial designs and it may open up a new avenue in electromagnetic materials-by-design.},

The thin dielectric samples, backed by a short circuit, are placed flush with the probe. The complex permittivities of the samples are determined from the coaxial aperture reflection coefficient, which is measured by a vector network analyser. In order to realize fast measurements, only the fundamental coaxial mode is considered in the determination of the permittivity of a sample from the measured reflection coefficient. However, in calibration computations, both the fundamental mode and higher-order modes are considered in order to ensure that the measurement system is accurately calibrated. Two practical measurement set-ups are specifically developed, for thin solid samples and thin liquid samples, respectively, in order to minimize various measurement errors and to make the measurements convenient. To validate this technique, experimental measurements are carried out on several different dielectric materials, including low-, medium- and high-permittivity materials. The measured data are found to be in good agreement with the known data. The limitations of this technique are also discussed.},

Integrated photonic networks are particularly powerful in performing analog computing of matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) as they afford unparalleled speed and bandwidth density for data transmission. Incorporating nonvolatile phase-change materials in integrated photonic devices enables indispensable programming and in-memory computing capabilities for on-chip optical computing. Here, we demonstrate a multimode photonic computing core consisting of an array of programable mode converters based on on-waveguide metasurfaces made of phase-change materials. The programmable converters utilize the refractive index change of the phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 during phase transition to control the waveguide spatial modes with a very high precision of up to~64 levels in modal contrast. This contrast is used to represent the matrix elements, with 6-bit resolution and both positive and negative values, to perform MVM computation in neural network algorithms. We demonstrate a prototypical optical convolutional neural network that can perform image processing and recognition tasks with high accuracy. With a broad operation bandwidth and a compact device footprint, the demonstrated multimode photonic core is promising toward large-scale photonic neural networks with ultrahigh computation throughputs.},

Given the structural inhomogeneity at the nanoscale or sub-nanoscale in these materials, dielectric response characterization based on terahertz (THz) electromagnetic-probe beam fields is intrinsically coordinated to lattice dynamics during DC-biased poling cycles. The complex permittivity reveals the field-induced phase transitions to be irreversible. This profoundly counters the claim of reversibility, the conventional support for which is based upon the peak that is manifest in each of four quadrants of the current\textendash field curves. The mechanism of this irreversibility is solely attributed to polar clusters in the transformed lattices. These represent an extrinsic factor, which is quiescent in the THz spectral domain.},

Implementing these changes results in increased computational efficiency when compared to the traditional fast plane wave expansion method (FPWEM). In order to increase the band gap width produced by the PnCs, an adaptive genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the PnCs structural topology for in-plane wave mode (xy mode).

  abstract = {Surface plasmon tuning via thermally induced refractive index changes in ferroelectrics is investigated. Epitaxial (Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST) thin films were deposited on MgO (001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The refractive index of BST thin films measured by the prism-coupling technique was found to increase from 2.3932 (TE)/1.9945 (TM) at room temperature to 2.3949 (TE)/1.9965 (TM) at 66\textdegree C. Then 30-nm-Ag gratings with periodicity 750~nm and width 300~nm were fabricated on BST by soft ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography and subsequent lift-off process. The reflection spectra from 500 to 1000~nm with incident angle from 5\textdegree{} to 60\textdegree{} were measured at room temperature and 66\textdegree C, with a collimated and p-polarized light incident perpendicularly to the grating direction. Several modes were observed from the spectra. At 66\textdegree C, a red shift of a dip at about 850~nm by 2~nm was obtained at an incident angle of 15\textdegree. Calculations confirmed that the observed modes belong to the (-1), (2), (-2) and (3) surface plasmon modes from the Ag and BST interfaces and localized mode; the red shift by thermal tuning is also confirmed. The results indicate the feasibility of active modulation in surface plasmon resonance in solid-state structures.},

The expression giving the reflection coefficient in terms of the surface resistivity of a film on a thin substrate is developed by matching the electromagnetic fields at the aperture of the coaxial line. Experimental results of conductive thin films on thin substrates (indium tin-oxide thin film deposited on polyethylene substrates) and dielectric substrates without films are reported from DC to 4 GHz.

The response of the single-speaker trained DSNNs to all 16 speakers is similar to the 16-speaker-trained DSNN responses. TW training results in an ordering of the expected responses to the 9 words of the non-TW set. The ordering determined by single-speaker training matches the ordering determined by multi-speaker training; and in many instances, the single-speaker trained DSNN output matches the multi-speaker trained DSNN output. While searching the parameter space to best solve the isolated word recognition task, the GA implicitly searched the input space to find the input subset best describing the separatrix between TWs and non-TWs. Computation is decreased by concentrating optimization on this subset. The GA adapts as knowledge of this subset is learned. The GA begins as a random search, becoming a steady state GA and then a simple elitist GA over the course of optimization.},

Also, we evaluated the acceleration performance of the three-dimensional solidification simulation by using a single NVIDIA TESLA C1060 GPU and the developed program code. The results showed that the GPU calculation for 5763 computational grids achieved the performance of 170 GFLOPS by utilizing the shared memory as a software-managed cache. Furthermore, it can be demonstrated that the computation with the GPU is 100 times faster than that with a single CPU core.

In this Letter, we examine the impact of initial geometric layout on the performance of large-angle (75\&\#x00A0;deg) topology-optimized metagrating deflectors. We find that when conventional metasurface designs based on dielectric nanoposts are used as initial layouts for topology optimization, the final devices have efficiencies around 65\%. In contrast, when random initial layouts are used, the final devices have ultra-high efficiencies that can reach 94\%. Our numerical experiments suggest that device topologies based on conventional metasurface designs may not be suitable to produce ultra-high-efficiency, large-angle metasurfaces. Rather, initial geometric layouts with non-trivial topologies and shapes are required.},

By modulating the carrier density using different pump fluences, we observe a wide tuning of the electric dipole resonance of the transient GaAs metasurface from 0.5 THz to 1.7 THz. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that the metasurface presented here can be generalized to more complex architectures for realizing functionalities such as perfect absorption, leading to a 30 dB modulation depth.

The hybrid metamaterial unit structure consists of a split-ring metal pattern and a metal sheet separated by a dielectric resonator spacer. The polarization conversion ratio (PCR) is above 90\% from 2.06 to 4.26~THz, with an optimal range between 2.98 and 4.16~THz where the efficiency is above 98\% for normal incidence. It also shows excellent performance for oblique incidences. Moreover, the working band and the optimized frequency range for the polarization conversion can be manipulated by changing the open angle between the metallic arcs and the substrate thickness, respectively. Based on this design, two types of hybrid metamaterial converters are also investigated to swith off polarization conversion altogether or modify the polarization conversion bandwidth. A polarization converter with temperature controlled PCR is realized by adding a vanadium oxide (VO2) mask on the designed structure. In addition, by integrating photoconductive silicon islands between the split-ring and metal bar a dual-band polarization converter can be realized. Combining with a polarizer, this window can act as an active THz filter.},

QNM perturbation theories (PTs) are one ideal choice. However, existing theories developed for tiny material changes are unable to provide accurate perturbation corrections for shape deformations. By introducing a novel extrapolation technique, we develop a rigorous QNM PT that faithfully represents the electromagnetic fields in perturbed domain. Numerical tests performed on the eigenfrequencies, eigenmodes, and optical responses of deformed nanoresonators evidence the predictive force of the present PT, even for large deformations. This opens new avenues for inverse design, as we exemplify by designing super-cavity modes and exceptional points with remarkable ease and physical insight.},

  abstract = {The properties of bandgaps (BGs) for manipulating elastic/acoustic waves are highly determined by the spatial distribution of materials in the primitive unit cell. In this work, the topological optimization strategy is implemented to design thin elastic metamaterial plates to broaden the total relative width of flexural vibration bandgaps (FVBGs). It is formulated based on the adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) and solved using the improved fast plane wave expansion method (IFPWEM), which can contribute to improving the efficiency of optimization. The effects of initial designs and material volume fraction constraints on the optimization are discussed in detail. Based on the optimized solutions evolved from Initialization IV and volume fraction constraint f0~=~0.25, the wave propagation (iso-frequency contours, the phase, and group velocities) is utilized to investigate the physical mechanisms. The numerical and experimental results of the finite-size lattices composed of optimized unit cells demonstrate that out-of-plane flexural waves can be transmitted or prohibited, which is in perfect match with the predicted results of band structures. Additionally, the present methodology is expected to explore their potential application in the vibration attenuation of the two-component thin elastic metamaterials plates.},

The realization of these devices needs building blocks of metamaterials with negative permittivities and permeabilities. However, superscattering effects, such as stopping wave propagation in an air channel, have not been verified from illusion devices physically because of the challenge of metamaterial design, fabrication, and material loss. In this Letter, we implement a big metamaterial superscatterer, and experimentally demonstrate its superscattering effect at microwave frequencies by field-mapping technology. We confirm that superscattering is originated from the excitation of surface plasmons. Integrated with superscatterer, we experimentally display that an invisible gateway could stop electromagnetic waves in an air channel with a width much larger than the cutoff width of the corresponding rectangular waveguide. Our results provide a first direct observation of superscattering effect of double negative metamaterials and invisible gateway for electromagnetic waves. It builds up an ideal platform for future designs of other illusion devices.},

This study aims to develop an electromechanically-coupled analytical model of PEH skin considering the inertia and stiffness effects of a piezoelectric patch. Based on Kirchhoff plate theory, Hamilton's principle is used to derive the electromechanically-coupled differential equation of motion. Due to the geometric discontinuity of the piezoelectric patch, the Rayleigh\textendash Ritz method is applied to calculate the natural frequency and corresponding mode shapes. The electrical circuit equation is derived from Gauss's law. Output voltage is estimated by solving the equation of motion and electrical circuit equation, simultaneously. For the purpose of evaluating the predictive capability, the results of the electromechanically-coupled analytical model are compared with those of the finite element method in a hierarchical manner. The outstanding merits of the electromechanically-coupled analytical model of PEH skin are three-fold: (1) consideration of the inertia and stiffness effects of the piezoelectric patches; (2) physical parameterization between the two-dimensional mechanical configuration and piezoelectric transduction; (3) manipulability of the twisting modes of a cantilever plate with a small aspect ratio.},

The principal advantage of MAXIM is an intuitive graphical user interface drastically improving the accessibility of the software to who are not familiar with computer programming. Here, we present the basic formulation and computation methods that are incorporated in MAXIM. The computation performance is also evaluated for several didactic examples of dielectric metasurfaces which are the main application of MAXIM. The comparison of the calculation results with commercial software based on a finite-difference time-domain method confirms that the computation results of two programs coincide closely with each other within 1\% difference. Considering the easy accessibility, wide availability and high reliability, MAXIM will serve the development of related research fields of metasurfaces and nanophotonics. Program summary Program Title: MAXIM CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/352jpd593h.1 Licensing provisions: LGPL Programming language: Python 3.8 Supplementary material: User guide and tutorial movie Nature of problem: Time-harmonic electromagnetic wave simulations on multilayered periodic structures composed of isotropic materials. Diffraction occurs as a propagating electromagnetic wave meets periodically-structured arrays of materials that have different refractive indices. Wave parameters such as amplitude and phase of diffracted waves are modulated depending on the structure configuration. The main purpose of this software is to calculate complex transmission and reflection coefficients of diffracted waves from dielectric metasurfaces that are composed of arrays of subwavelength antennas. Solution method: Rigorous coupled-wave analysis associated with an extended scattering matrix method. According to Bloch's theorem, diffracted waves from periodic structures can be represented as a truncated Fourier series in which the primitive reciprocal vector is the same as that of periodic structures. Appropriate boundary conditions at the interface of a single structure layer enable development of an eigenvalue equation for which the solution gives a scattering matrix of the layer, and the coupling coefficients within it. In the case of a multilayered structure, a total scattering matrix can be obtained using the Redheffer star product, which interconnects scattering matrices of each layer. Total coupling coefficients can be also calculated using the extended Redheffer star product; this ability is a major advantage of the extended scattering matrix method. Diffraction from periodic structures can be fully described by the total scattering matrix and total coupling coefficients.

So far, most of studies in this field are focused on designing a static photonic structure.

Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a reprogrammable plasmonic topological insulator, where the topological propagation route can be dynamically changed at nanosecond-level switching time, leading to an experimental demonstration of ultrafast multi-channel optical analog-digital converter. Due to the innovative use of electric switches to implement the programmability of plasmonic topological insulator, each unit cell can be encoded by dynamically controlling its digital plasmonic states while keeping its geometry and material parameters unchanged. Our reprogrammable topological plasmonic platform is fabricated by the printed circuit board technology, making it much more compatible with integrated photoelectric systems. Furthermore, due to its flexible programmability, many photonic topological functionalities can be integrated into this versatile topological platform.},

Because of these characteristic properties, there has been an increasing interest in terahertz imaging and spectroscopy for biological applications within the last few years and more and more terahertz spectra are being reported, including spectroscopic studies of cancer. The presence of cancer often causes increased blood supply to affected tissues and a local increase in tissue water content may be observed: this acts as a natural contrast mechanism for terahertz imaging of cancer. Furthermore the structural changes that occur in affected tissues have also been shown to contribute to terahertz image contrast. This paper introduces terahertz technology and provides a short review of recent advances in terahertz imaging and spectroscopy techniques.

Such substrates are deployed in, for example, integrated circuits for synthesizing and converting nonplanar and 3D structures into planar forms. The Rutile form of titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely accepted as commercially economical candidate substrate that meets demands for both low-loss and high permittivities at sub-THz bands. However, the relationship between its mechanisms of dielectric response to the microstructure have never been systematically investigated in order to engineer ultra-low dielectric-loss and high value, dispersionless permittivities. Here we show TiO2 THz dielectrics with high permittivity (ca. 102.30) and ultra-low loss (ca. 0.0042). These were prepared by insight gleaned from a broad use of materials characterisation methods to successfully engineer porosities, second phase, crystallography shear-planes and oxygen vacancies during sintering. The dielectric loss achieved here is not only with negligible dispersion over 0.2\textendash 0.8\,THz, but also has the lowest value measured for known high-permittivity dielectrics. We expect the insight afforded by this study will underpin the development of subwavelength-scale, planar integrated circuits, compact high Q-resonators and broadband, slow-light devices in the THz band.},

For this reason, there has recently been a surge of interest in performing wave-based analogue computations that avoid analogue-to-digital conversion and allow massively parallel operation. In particular, novel schemes for wave-based analogue computing have been proposed based on artificially engineered photonic structures, that is, metamaterials. Such kinds of computing systems, referred to as computational metamaterials, can be as fast as the speed of light and as small as its wavelength, yet, impart complex mathematical operations on an incoming wave packet or even provide solutions to integro-differential equations. These much-sought features promise to enable a new generation of ultra-fast, compact and efficient processing and computing hardware based on light-wave propagation. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the field of computational metamaterials, surveying the state-of-the-art metastructures proposed to perform analogue computation. We further describe some of the most exciting applications suggested for these computing systems, including image processing, edge detection, equation solving and machine learning.

The electric displacement\textendash electric field loops results revealed that the increasing spontaneous polarization with the STO film that was induced was responsible for the larger refractive index variation of the BST/STO sample.

However, realizing independent dual-tunability remains challenging and requires more efforts. In this paper, we present an active metasurface where the magnitude and frequency of the resonant absorption can be continuously and independently tuned through application of voltage biases. Such a dual-tunability is accomplished at microwave frequencies by combining a varactor-loaded high-impedance surface and a graphene-based sandwich structure. By electrically controlling the Fermi energy of graphene and the capacitance of varactor diodes, we experimentally demonstrate the independent shifting of the working frequency from 3.41 to 4.55 GHz and tuning of the reflection amplitude between -3 and -30 dB, which is in excellent agreement with full-wave numerical simulations. We further employed an equivalent lumped circuit model to elucidate the mechanism of the dual-tunability resulting from the graphene-based sandwich structure and the active high-impedance surface. We speculate that such a dual-tunability scheme can be potentially extended to terahertz and optical regimes by employing different active/dynamical tuning methods and materials integration, thereby enabling a variety of practical applications.},

However, high tunability is often associated with high loss and high dielectric permittivity. Here, a novel material, textured Sr2(Ta1\textendash xNbx)2O7 (STN), with a layered perovskite structure, has been designed to break this correlation. These materials exhibit low dielectric loss associated with oxygen vacancy elimination through the creation of stacking faults in the layered structure, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A modification of the Vendik model was used to fit the thermal dependence of their relative dielectric permittivity, which included an oxygen defect parameter as an indicator of the oxygen defect concentration. The high tunability is attributed to the presence of local polar nanoclusters just above the Curie point. A two-step spark plasma sintering method was employed to prepare grain-oriented ceramics with optimized properties. A near-optimum maximum tunability of 72\% at room temperature was obtained for a textured Sr2Ta1.88Nb0.12O7 ceramic, with moderate dielectric permittivity ({$\epsilon{'}$} {$\sim$} 520) and a dielectric loss of less than 1\%.},

However, most studies in the field of metasurface reflectors focus on the diffusion generated by a phase gradient from unit cells in periodic grids. In this paper, we propose a general idea of integrating the concept of a hyperuniform disordered structure to realize a metasurface, where the effect of the spatial distribution is taken into account to realize more diffusion. A V-shaped structure is utilized as the unit cell for the metasurface to realize two kinds of elements with a phase difference of 180\textdegree. The metasurface is generated by distributing the unit cells according to a hyperuniform disordered distribution, and we compared its performance with a metasurface comprised of the same unit cells, distributed on a fixed periodic lattice. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the metasurface with the hyperuniform disorder performs better than the periodic metasurface by enlarging the operating bandwidth with a significant reduction in the radar cross section of the surface. When the frequency operating frequency increases, only one reflected beam is observed for the metasurfaces based on hyperuniform disordered distribution, which is in contrast to the periodic metasurface where several multiple reflected beams are observed.},

Here, we propose a general and computationally efficient inverse-design framework based on multipole decomposition and adjoint optimization. By this method, we demonstrate an achromatic metalens working across the visible and near-infrared band with a bandwidth over 400 nm. We also show the design of the metasurface for multiplexed focusing at the RGB wavelength, and the metasurface for stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, which generates a tightly focusing point at the excitation beam wavelength and doughnut-shaped focus for the STED beam wavelength.

In order to better understand the electroaeroelastic behavior and further improve the galloping piezoelectric energy harvester (GPEH), an effective analytical model is required, which needs to incorporate both the electromechanical coupling and the aerodynamic force. Available electromechanical models for the GPEH include the lumped parameter single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model, the approximated distributed parameter model based on Rayleigh\textendash Ritz discretization, and the distributed parameter model with Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam representation. Each modeling method has its own advantages. The corresponding aerodynamic models are formulated using quasi-steady hypothesis (QSH). In this paper, the SDOF model, the Euler\textendash Bernoulli distributed parameter model using single mode and the Euler\textendash Bernoulli distributed parameter model using multi-modes are compared and validated with experimental results. Based on the comparison and validation, the most effective model is employed for the subsequent parametric study. The effects of load resistance, wind exposure area of the bluff body, mass of the bluff body and length of the piezoelectric sheets on the power output are investigated. These simulations can be exploited for designing and optimizing GPEHs for better performance.},

Here, a birefringent dielectric metasurface with the capability of encoding a grayscale image in real-space based on Malus's law by utilizing the inhomogeneous polarization distribution and realizing the reconstruction of a vectorial holographic image in k-space with the help of the phase profiles of different polarization components of output light is demonstrated.

Instead of starting with Kirchhoff-type of assumptions, we directly apply perturbation analysis, in terms of the small parameter introduced by the thinness of composite plates, to the original three-dimensional governing elastostatic equations. The present article sees its intriguing points in the following three aspects. First, it is shown that transverse loads applied on a thin laminated plate induce an in-plane stress response, which essentially differs from the case of single-layered homogenous plates. A scaling law estimating the magnitude of the in-plane stresses due to transverse loads is then given, and a size effect in such induced in-plane stresses arises. Second, the stress state at any position of interest in the original three-dimensional configuration can be asymptotically estimated following a (de-)homogenization scheme, and the (de-homogenization) accuracy is shown, both theoretically and numerically, to be at a same order of magnitude as the thickness-to-size ratio. Third, the asymptotic analysis here identifies the right order of magnitude for the transverse normal strain, which is often set to vanish, leading to the so-called Poisson?s locking problem in classical thin plate theories.},

Numerical examples showed that the effective permittivity and permeability of the composites with cubic inclusions, formerly known to have the lowest permittivity, are closer to the Hashin-Strikman bounds than those obtained from other methods. To tailor the specific effective properties, an inverse homogenization procedure is proposed within the framework of vector wave equations. Some novel metamaterial microstructures with a range of specific effective permittivity and/or permeability are obtained. By maximizing the permittivity and permeability at the same time, a structure with minimal surface area (the mean curvature of the surface equals zero everywhere), namely, the well-known Schwarz primitive structure, is obtained. Similarly to the nano-spheres (dielectric spheres covered by plasmonic shells) with negative refraction, we generalize the Schwarz primitive structure and its analogy (e.g., those with a constant mean curvature surface) to one class of chiral composites by embedding one of these structures with smaller volume fraction (nonmagnetic inclusive cores) into another with large volume fraction (metal shell). Such composites have potential to provide better behaviors because they can best utilize different components. The anisotropic composites and multiple solutions to the inverse homogenization are also illustrated.},

The silicon pillar meta-units of the metasurface are properly selected to generate different phase profiles for two orthogonal linear polarizations, permitting a laterally or axially altered focal spot. After LCs integrated, polarization-multiplexed focusing can be achieved via electrically varying the LC orientations. We demonstrate two metalenses with distinct functions. For the first one, the uniformly aligned LC works as a polarization converter, and further switches the focal length by altering the bias. For the second one, an LC polarization grating is utilized for rear spin-selective beam deflection. Consequently, a THz port selector is presented. This work supplies a promising method towards active THz elements, which may be widely applied in THz sensing, imaging, and communication.},

In order to shed more light on the property of temperature dependence, we performed a systematic investigation by changing the temperature of the water sample and using a terahertz time-domain spectrometer. The experimental results show that when the temperature increases from 275 K to 340 K, the refractive index and the complex dielectric constant of water increase noticeable, with the absorption coefficient increased observably.

As a result, the sensitivity is significantly improved, theoretically about 7 and 18 times higher than that of the conventional cross-shaped absorber and its complementary cross-shaped absorber, respectively. We then experimentally demonstrate its ability to quantitatively detect biotin with a sensitivity of 153\,GHz/{$\mu$}M, higher than that of previously reported biotin sensors. Additionally, the polarization-independent nanostructure decreases the design and fabrication complexity and maintains high reflection at a wide range of incident angles over {$\pm$}50\textdegree.

In particular, we focus on the computation in semi-analytical methods (such as rigorous coupled-wave analysis).

However, when it comes to computing scattering matrix derivatives, differentiating the eigen-decomposition poses significant numerical difficulties. We show that the differentiation of the eigen-decomposition problem can be completely sidestepped, and thereby propose a robust algorithm. To demonstrate its efficacy, we use our algorithm to optimize metasurface structures and reach various optical design goals.},

Simulation and experimental results are given that demonstrate the realization of DNG metamaterials matched to free-space. The extraction of the effective permittivity and permeability for these metamaterials from reflection and transmission data at normal incidence is treated.

  abstract = {Wave propagation in a double negative (DNG) medium, i.e., a medium having negative permittivity and negative permeability, is studied both analytically and numerically. The choices of the square root that leads to the index of refraction and the wave impedance in a DNG medium are determined by imposing analyticity in the complex frequency domain, and the corresponding wave properties associated with each choice are presented. These monochromatic concepts are then tested critically via a one-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation of the propagation of a causal, pulsed plane wave in a matched, lossy Drude model DNG medium. The causal responses of different spectral regimes of the medium with positive or negative refractive indices are studied by varying the carrier frequency of narrowband pulse excitations. The smooth transition of the phenomena associated with a DNG medium from its early-time nondispersive behavior to its late-time monochromatic response is explored with wideband pulse excitations. These FDTD results show conclusively that the square root choice leading to a negative index of refraction and positive wave impedance is the correct one, and that this choice is consistent with the overall causality of the response. An analytical, exact frequency domain solution to the scattering of a wave from a DNG slab is also given and is used to characterize several physical effects. This solution is independent of the choice of the square roots for the index of refraction and the wave impedance, and thus avoids any controversy that may arise in connection with the signs of these constituents. The DNG slab solution is used to critically examine the perfect lens concept suggested recently by Pendry. It is shown that the perfect lens effect exists only under the special case of a DNG medium with {$\epsilon$}({$\omega$})={$\mu$}({$\omega$})=-1 that is both lossless and nondispersive. Otherwise, the closed form solutions for the field structure reveal that the DNG slab converts an incident spherical wave into a localized beam field whose parameters depend on the values of {$\epsilon$} and {$\mu$}. This beam field is characterized with a paraxial approximation of the exact DNG slab solution. These monochromatic concepts are again explored numerically via a causal two-dimensional FDTD simulation of the scattering of a pulsed cylindrical wave by a matched, lossy Drude model DNG slab. These FDTD results demonstrate conclusively that the monochromatic electromagnetic power flow through the DNG slab is channeled into beams rather then being focused and, hence, the Pendry perfect lens effect is not realizable with any realistic metamaterial.},

It is shown that the optical behavior of such films corresponds to the averaged contribution of a number of stochastic pitch variation profiles, due to the transversal and longitudinal nonuniformities that develop in the helical structure of such samples. Depending on the annealing time, both narrow-band and broadband behavior can be selectively achieved. The influence of the pitch profile gradient on the broadband reflection performance of cholesteric samples is theoretically analyzed, and a multi-slab structure for achieving optimum efficiency is proposed.},

The asymptotic analysis relies on the multi-scale method which is a tool in the theory of homogenization with rapidly oscillating coefficients [2]. We note a singular perturbation for the divergence of the electromagnetic field associated to scaled permittivity {$\epsilon$}(x/{$\eta$}) and permeability {$\mu$}(x/{$\eta$}), which are periodic functions of period {$\eta\ll$}1. We establish the sharp convergence of the oscillating field towards the homogenized one via the notion of two-scale convergence [1]. We finally solve numerically the associated system of partial differential equations with a Finite Element Method in order to exhibit the matrices of effective permittivity and permeability for given 2D ferro-magnetic periodic composites.},

We analyze the electromagnetic response of the cloak in the presence of an electric line source in p polarization and a loop of magnetic current in s polarization. We find that the electromagnetic field radiated by such a source located a fraction of a wavelength from the cloak is perturbed by less than 1\%. When the source lies in the coating, it seems to radiate from a shifted location.},
